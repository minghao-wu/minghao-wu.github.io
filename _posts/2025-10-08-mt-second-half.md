Many think that machine translation (MT) is a solved problem, but is it really? While significant progress has been made with models like GPT-4 and other large language models, challenges remain.

After the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, many believed that MT was effectively "solved". In my own analysis of the arXiv submissions, I observed that the last burst of MT papers occurred around mid-2023. Since then, the number of MT-related submissions has decreased significantly, suggesting a decline in research interest.

However, **is MT truly dead?** I would argue that it is not, given what I experienced at ACL2025, Vienna, Austria. I fluently speak and write in both English and Chinese, but struggled with ordering food deliveries via an app in German. **So, what's the second half of machine translation?**

## The First Half

The first half of machine translation primarily focused on improving the translation quality. Early approaches included rule-based systems, which relied on linguistic rules and dictionaries to perform translations. These systems were limited by their inability to handle the complexities and nuances of natural language. Then, statistical machine translation (SMT) emerged, leveraging large parallel corpora to learn translation patterns. SMT significantly improved translation quality but still struggled with fluency and context. Next, neural machine translation (NMT) revolutionized the field by using deep learning techniques to model the entire translation process. NMT systems, particularly those based on the Transformer architecture, achieved state-of-the-art results and became the dominant approach in MT.

More recently, large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have demonstrated impressive zero-shot and few-shot translation capabilities. These models can generate high-quality translations without task-specific training, making them versatile and powerful tools for MT. Recent studies even claim that human evaluators often prefer translations generated by LLMs over those produced by human translators.

## The Second Half

Current MT systems can even perform on par with or better than human translators in certain scenarios. So, what is the next step? Where should MT research go from here?

I believe that the second half of machine translation should start from the evaluation perspective. Although some researchers claim that their approaches outperform humans, are they really better than humans? In my opinion, the answer is no, even though one of my own papers made such a claim. The reason is that current MT evaluation methods are all flawed:

* Lexical-based metrics like BLEU do not capture semantic meaning and context, leading to misleading evaluations. Every MT researcher knows that BLEU is not a good metric, yet every MT researcher still wants to see the BLEU score. 
* Neural-based metrics like BERTScore and COMET, while more advanced, still struggle with understanding nuances and cultural context. These metrics lack transparency and interpretability, making it difficult to understand why a model receives a certain score. They are also likely to be biased towards certain languages, styles, or domains, leading to unfair evaluations.
* LLM-based evaluations, such as GPT-4 scoring, are promising but still in their infancy. Their limitations are similar to those of neural-based metrics.
* Human evaluations are commonly considered the gold standard. However, besides being time-consuming and expensive, they are also subjective and inconsistent. Different evaluators may have different criteria and preferences, leading to variability in scores.

In my opinion, my bet is on LLM-based evaluation, as LLMs exhibit a higher level of evaluation consistency compared to human evaluators and are equipped with a better understanding of context and semantics. For example, when evaluating translations requiring historical or cultural knowledge, LLMs can leverage their extensive training data to provide more accurate assessments, while you cannot expect every human evaluator to possess such knowledge.

## Low-Resource Languages?

Another long-standing challenge in both MT and the broader NLP field is the issue of low-resource languages. Although I indeed advocate for more accessible and equitable MT systems and AI technologies, I am not optimistic about the future of low-resource language technologies. The reason is not technological but economic and social. Technology and economy are intertwined. Languages are not that different. English, Chinese, or Swahili are no different to a newborn baby. The technology likewise. If there is no economic incentive or social demand for a language, it is unlikely that significant resources will be allocated to develop technologies for that language. Currently, there are more than 7,000 languages spoken worldwide, but my most optimistic prediction is that in the next century, the number of living languages will shrink to around 100. The impact of post-colonialism, globalization, and the dominance of a few major languages will likely lead to the extinction of many minority languages, and language technologies like large language models are likely to accelerate this process.

## Conclusion

Well, what do you think? Is MT really dead? If not, what is the second half of MT? MT evaluation might not be the second half, but if we want to move into the second half of MT, we need to rethink how we evaluate MT systems.
