This is my first blog post. I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences here. Stay tuned for more content!

Let's try some math here using Latex:

Block equation: 
$$E = mc^2$$

Inline equation: The famous equation \(E = mc^2\) revolutionized physics.

More complex examples:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}$$

$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$$

Matrix equation:
$$\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} ax + by \\ cx + dy \end{pmatrix}$$
