This is my first blog post. I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences here. Stay tuned for more content!

Let's try some math here using Latex:

Block equation: 
$$E = mc^2$$

Inline equation: The famous equation $E = mc^2$ revolutionized physics.

More complex examples:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}$$

$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$$

Matrix equation:
$$\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} ax + by \\ cx + dy \end{pmatrix}$$

Calligraphic fonts with \mathcal{}:
$$\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}m\dot{x}^2 - V(x)$$

$$\mathcal{F}(f)(w) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{-2\pi i wx} dx$$

Blackboard bold fonts with \mathbb{}:
$$\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}, \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{N}, \mathbb{Q}$$

$$f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$$

Combined usage:
$$\mathcal{H}: L^2(\mathbb{R}) \to L^2(\mathbb{R})$$

$$\mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{\mathbb{R}} x \, d\mathcal{P}(x)$$

## Cross-referencing Examples

Consider the famous equation in Equation (1):
$$E = mc^2 \tag{1}$$

We can refer back to Equation (1) later in the text.

For numbered equations, you can also use:
$$\begin{equation}
F = ma \label{eq:newton}
\end{equation}$$

And reference it as Newton's second law (Equation 2).

## Using Markdown anchors
You can create anchors and link to them:

<a name="important-theorem"></a>
**Theorem 1**: The fundamental theorem of calculus states...

Later, you can reference [Theorem 1](#important-theorem).
