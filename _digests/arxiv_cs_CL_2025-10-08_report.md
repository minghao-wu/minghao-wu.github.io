Today's research landscape showcases significant advances in multi-agent collaboration frameworks, with several papers proposing innovative approaches to enhance reasoning capabilities through structured interaction. The Double-Loop Multi-Agent (DLMA) framework introduces a bilevel optimization strategy where "professor" agents evolve research plans while "doctoral student" agents execute them, achieving state-of-the-art results in automated scientific research. Similarly, Self-Signals Driven Multi-LLM Debate (SID) leverages internal model confidence and attention patterns to optimize multi-agent debate efficiency, while ToolMem enhances multimodal agents with learnable capability memories for improved tool selection. In reinforcement learning, λ-GRPO addresses length bias in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) through adaptive token weighting, and the PiKa dataset demonstrates that expert-level synthetic data can achieve superior alignment with just 30k examples—dramatically improving data efficiency. These works collectively highlight a trend toward more sophisticated, efficient, and self-aware AI systems capable of complex, multi-step problem-solving.

# A Multi-Agent Framework for Stateful Inference-Time Search

Authors: Arshika Lalan, Rajat Ghosh, Aditya Kolsur, Debojyoti Dutta

Keywords: Multi-Agent Framework, Stateful Inference, Evolutionary Search, Unit Test Generation, Code Coverage

## Abstract

Recent work explores agentic inference-time techniques to perform structured, multi-step reasoning. However, stateless inference often struggles on multi-step tasks due to the absence of persistent state. Moreover, task-specific fine-tuning or instruction-tuning often achieve surface-level code generation but remain brittle on tasks requiring deeper reasoning and long-horizon dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose stateful multi-agent evolutionary search, a training-free framework that departs from prior stateless approaches by combining (i) persistent inference-time state, (ii) adversarial mutation, and (iii) evolutionary preservation. We demonstrate its effectiveness in automated unit test generation through the generation of edge cases. We generate robust edge cases using an evolutionary search process, where specialized agents sequentially propose, mutate, and score candidates. A controller maintains persistent state across generations, while evolutionary preservation ensures diversity and exploration across all possible cases. This yields a generalist agent capable of discovering robust, high-coverage edge cases across unseen codebases. Experiments show our stateful multi-agent inference framework achieves substantial gains in coverage over stateless single-step baselines, evaluated on prevalent unit-testing benchmarks such as HumanEval and TestGenEvalMini and using three diverse LLM families - Llama, Gemma, and GPT. These results indicate that combining persistent inference-time state with evolutionary search materially improves unit-test generation.

## Summary

This paper introduces a stateful multi-agent evolutionary search framework for automated unit test generation, addressing limitations of stateless inference-time approaches in complex reasoning tasks. The key contribution is a training-free system that maintains persistent state across inference iterations, combining evolutionary search with adversarial guidance to generate robust edge cases with high code coverage.

The methodology employs four specialized agents orchestrated by a controller: an Actor proposes candidate edge cases, an Adversary generates code mutants to test robustness, a Critic integrates coverage, mutation, and exception signals into reward scores, and an Executor provides sandboxed evaluation. The framework begins with rule-based cold-start initialization and evolves through multiple stages, with the controller maintaining state information including prior edge cases, mutation scores, coverage metrics, and reward history. This stateful approach enables the system to build upon previous reasoning rather than starting from scratch in each iteration.

Experiments were conducted on HumanEval and a newly introduced TestGenEvalMini benchmark, using three LLM families (Llama-70B, GPT-o4-mini, Gemma-2-27B). Results show that the proposed system achieves substantial coverage improvements over stateless baselines (zero-shot, one-shot, three-shot with and without chain-of-thought). On TestGenEvalMini, the framework consistently outperformed baselines in line and function coverage, though branch coverage showed some variation across models. Notably, 62% of HumanEval problems were resolved in a single iteration via the cold-start mechanism, demonstrating efficiency on simpler tasks, while TestGenEvalMini required more extensive search, highlighting the framework's ability to scale to complex, real-world codebases at the cost of increased computational overhead.

The work demonstrates that inference-time state management combined with evolutionary search and multi-agent coordination can significantly enhance LLM performance on complex reasoning tasks without requiring model fine-tuning, paving the way for more adaptive and robust automated software testing systems.

## Critique

Of course. Here is a critique of the paper "A Multi-Agent Framework for Stateful Inference-Time Search," covering its strengths and weaknesses.

### Overall Assessment

This paper presents a well-motivated and technically detailed framework for improving automated unit test generation using a multi-agent, stateful, evolutionary search process. It addresses a clear gap in LLM-based reasoning and demonstrates promising results, though some aspects of the evaluation and presentation could be strengthened.

---

### Strengths

1.  **Novelty of the Approach:** The core idea of combining **stateful inference**, **multi-agent collaboration**, and **evolutionary search** for a training-free solution is highly novel and timely. The paper correctly identifies the limitation of stateless LLM inference for multi-step reasoning tasks. The integration of an adversarial mutation step to guide the search toward robust tests, rather than just syntactically correct ones, is a particularly strong and well-justified design choice.

2.  **Well-Defined Methodology:** The framework is described with exceptional clarity and rigor. The paper provides formal definitions for each component (State, Actor, Adversary, Critic, Executor, Controller) and a comprehensive algorithm (Algorithm 1). This makes the work easily understandable and, more importantly, reproducible. The "cold-start" mechanism using rule-based heuristics is a smart efficiency optimization.

3.  **Significance of the Task and Benchmark:** The choice of automated unit test generation is an excellent testbed for complex reasoning. The introduction and use of **TestGenEvalMini**, a curated subset of a real-world benchmark, is a significant contribution. It moves beyond the often-too-simple HumanEval tasks and provides a more realistic challenge, which is crucial for advancing the field.

4.  **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The evaluation is thorough, using three different LLM families (Llama, GPT, Gemma) and comparing against six strong inference-time baselines (including few-shot and Chain-of-Thought). Reporting on multiple coverage metrics (line, branch, function) and computational cost (Figure 3) provides a multi-faceted view of the system's performance and trade-offs.

---

### Weaknesses

1.  **Inconsistent and Underwhelming Results:** While the results are positive, they are not as decisive as one might hope, which slightly undermines the significance of the claimed contribution.
    *   **HumanEval:** The framework shows no significant improvement over baselines, with the authors noting that the "cold-start" often solves the problem in one step. While this is framed as a strength of the cold-start, it also suggests the benchmark is not challenging enough to demonstrate the value of the complex multi-agent search.
    *   **TestGenEvalMini:** The results are mixed. While the framework (SUT) achieves the best line and function coverage, it is **outperformed in branch coverage by baselines for two of the three models** (GPT and Gemma). The authors provide a plausible explanation (a bias toward exception-heavy tests), but this is a notable weakness that isn't fully resolved. The absolute coverage numbers (e.g., ~29% line coverage for the best model) also indicate that the problem is far from solved, leaving room for substantial improvement.

2.  **Lack of Ablation Studies:** A major weakness is the absence of ablation studies. The framework has several key components (statefulness, multi-agent structure, evolutionary search, adversarial mutation). It is unclear how much each component contributes to the final performance. For instance, would a stateful but non-evolutionary approach work just as well? Is the adversarial critic crucial, or is coverage feedback sufficient? Without ablation, it's difficult to pinpoint the source of the gains.

3.  **Clarity of Presentation (Minor Issues):**
    *   **Figures 2, 3, 4:** The critique mentions these figures but they are not included in the provided text, only their captions ("Refer to caption") are present. For a full assessment, the actual data visualizations are critical.
    *   **Computational Cost:** The discussion of FLOPs in the appendix is detailed, but a higher-level summary of the practical cost (e.g., average number of LLM calls, total runtime compared to baselines) in the main text would be very useful for practitioners assessing the cost-benefit trade-off. Figure 3 touches on this but could be expanded.

### Conclusion

This paper introduces a novel and architecturally sound framework that makes a valuable contribution to the field of inference-time reasoning with LLMs. Its strengths lie in its innovative combination of ideas and its rigorous, reproducible methodology. However, the impact of the work is tempered by inconsistent benchmark results and a lack of ablation analysis to deconstruct which elements of the complex system are truly driving its performance. It represents a solid step forward and provides a strong foundation for future research, which should focus on more challenging benchmarks, thorough component analysis, and improving branch coverage performance.

# $λ$-GRPO: Unifying the GRPO Frameworks with Learnable Token Preferences

Authors: Yining Wang, Jinman Zhao, Chuangxin Zhao, Shuhao Guan, Gerald Penn, Shinan Liu

## Abstract

Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has been the dominant approach for improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recently, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has simplified this paradigm by replacing the reward and value models with rule-based verifiers. A prominent example is Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, GRPO inherently suffers from a length bias, since the same advantage is uniformly assigned to all tokens of a response. As a result, longer responses distribute the reward over more tokens and thus contribute disproportionately to gradient updates. Several variants, such as DAPO and Dr. GRPO, modify the token-level aggregation of the loss, yet these methods remain heuristic and offer limited interpretability regarding their implicit token preferences. In this work, we explore the possibility of allowing the model to learn its own token preference during optimization. We unify existing frameworks under a single formulation and introduce a learnable parameter $\lambda$ that adaptively controls token-level weighting. We use $\lambda$-GRPO to denote our method, and we find that $\lambda$-GRPO achieves consistent improvements over vanilla GRPO and DAPO on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks. On Qwen2.5 models with 1.5B, 3B, and 7B parameters, $\lambda$-GRPO improves average accuracy by $+1.9\%$, $+1.0\%$, and $+1.7\%$ compared to GRPO, respectively. Importantly, these gains come without any modifications to the training data or additional computational cost, highlighting the effectiveness and practicality of learning token preferences.

## Summary

This paper proposes λ-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework that unifies existing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) methods with learnable token preferences. The key contribution is addressing the inherent length bias in GRPO-based methods, where longer responses disproportionately influence gradient updates since advantages are uniformly assigned to all tokens in a response.

The authors present a unified formulation that encompasses GRPO, DAPO, and Dr. GRPO as special cases, differing only in their token aggregation schemes. Their method introduces a learnable parameter λ that adaptively controls token-level weighting based on response length distributions. The framework standardizes response lengths within groups and applies an exponent λ to adjust relative contributions: λ=0 treats all responses equally, λ>0 favors longer responses, and λ<0 emphasizes shorter ones. This allows the model to learn context-aware token preferences rather than relying on fixed heuristics.

Empirical results across Qwen2.5 models (1.5B, 3B, and 7B parameters) on 8 mathematical reasoning benchmarks show consistent improvements. λ-GRPO achieved average accuracy gains of +1.9%, +1.0%, and +1.7% over vanilla GRPO for the respective model sizes. The method also demonstrated better training dynamics, maintaining higher token-level entropy (indicating improved diversity) without increasing response length, suggesting a more efficient exploration-exploitation balance. These improvements come without additional computational cost or data requirements, highlighting the method's practicality and effectiveness.

## Critique

Of course. Here is a critique of the paper "λ-GRPO: Unifying the GRPO Frameworks with Learnable Token Preferences."

### Summary

This paper introduces **λ-GRPO**, a method that addresses the length bias problem in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by introducing a learnable parameter, λ, which allows the model to adaptively weight the contribution of tokens based on response length. It unifies existing GRPO variants (GRPO, DAPO, Dr.GRPO) under a single framework and demonstrates consistent performance improvements across multiple model scales (1.5B, 3B, 7B) on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

---

### Strengths

1.  **Clear Problem Formulation and Motivation:**
    *   The paper effectively identifies and explains the "length bias" problem inherent in GRPO and its variants. The motivation is well-grounded in existing literature, citing relevant prior work (Singhal et al., Hu et al.) to establish the significance of the problem.

2.  **Novel and Elegant Unification:**
    *   The core contribution—unifying GRPO, DAPO, and Dr.GRPO under a single framework defined by a weighting function `f(o_i)`—is both insightful and elegant. This provides a clear theoretical lens through which to understand the differences between these methods. The idea of replacing fixed heuristics with a learnable mechanism is a natural and compelling next step.

3.  **Simplicity and Practicality:**
    *   The proposed solution is conceptually simple and computationally lightweight. Introducing a single, jointly optimized parameter (λ) is a low-overhead modification that doesn't require changes to the training data or architecture, making it an attractive and practical improvement.

4.  **Comprehensive and Convincing Empirical Evaluation:**
    *   The evaluation is rigorous, testing across three different model sizes (1.5B, 3B, 7B) and eight distinct mathematical reasoning benchmarks. The consistent, albeit modest, improvements across the board are a strong point, as they demonstrate the robustness and scalability of the method.
    *   The analysis of learning dynamics (entropy and response length) provides valuable insights beyond raw accuracy, showing that λ-GRPO achieves higher output diversity without increasing verbosity, indicating a better exploration-exploitation balance.

5.  **Excellent Clarity and Presentation:**
    *   The paper is exceptionally well-written and structured. The use of a unified equation (Eq. 7) and a clear table to differentiate the weighting functions of prior methods makes the contribution easy to grasp.
    *   Figure 2 provides an intuitive visual explanation of how the scaling factor `r` and the learnable parameter λ function, which greatly aids understanding.

---

### Weaknesses

1.  **Limited Analysis of the Learned λ:**
    *   A significant weakness is the lack of analysis regarding the *final values* of the learned λ. The paper shows that the method works, but it doesn't delve into what the model actually learns. Do the final λ values converge to positive, negative, or near-zero numbers? Do they vary across different tasks or model sizes? Presenting a histogram or trend of λ over training for different runs would have been highly informative and strengthened the "learnable preference" claim.

2.  **Modest Performance Gains:**
    *   While consistent, the performance improvements are relatively modest (+0.9% to +1.9% average improvement over the best baseline). The paper correctly notes these gains are achieved without extra cost, which is a virtue, but the absolute significance of the improvement could be questioned. A discussion on whether these gains are considered substantial in the context of mathematical reasoning benchmarks would have been useful.

3.  **Narrow Scope of Evaluation:**
    *   The evaluation is confined entirely to mathematical reasoning tasks. It remains an open question whether the benefits of λ-GRPO generalize to other domains where length bias is a known issue, such as creative writing, dialogue, or code generation. A single experiment on a non-mathematical benchmark would have significantly strengthened the claim of general applicability.

4.  **Incomplete Baseline Comparison:**
    *   The decision to omit Dr.GRPO from the empirical comparison is a notable limitation. The argument that it differs from DAPO only by a constant factor is a theoretical point; an empirical comparison would have been more convincing to show that λ-GRPO outperforms all established variants.

5.  **Under-Specified "Why it Works" Section:**
    *   Section 2.4, titled "Why it works," is quite brief and somewhat hand-wavy. It reiterates the mechanism but doesn't provide a deeper theoretical or empirical analysis (e.g., showing reduced gradient variance or a more detailed ablation study on the effects of `r` and the softmax normalization).

---

### Overall Assessment

This is a **strong, well-executed paper** that makes a clear contribution. It identifies a genuine limitation in a popular RL framework, proposes a simple, novel, and well-motivated solution, and backs it up with thorough and convincing experiments in a specific domain. The key strength is its elegant unification of existing methods and the practical, low-cost nature of its improvement.

The main weaknesses lie in the analysis of the learned parameter itself and the narrowness of the evaluation domain. Addressing these—by analyzing λ's behavior and testing on diverse tasks—would elevate the paper from a solid incremental contribution to a more definitive and broadly impactful one. Despite these shortcomings, the paper presents a valuable and likely influential technique for the RLHF/RLVR community.

Authors: Shangjian Yin, Shining Liang, Wenbiao Ding, Yuli Qian, Zhouxing Shi, Hongzhi Li, Yutao Xie

Keywords: Synthetic Data Generation, Data-Efficient Alignment, Expert-Level Instructions, Persona-Based Generation, Post-Training Alignment, Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback, Preference Optimization

## Abstract

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a cornerstone for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness depends on high-quality instruction data. Most existing alignment datasets are either private or require costly human annotation, which limits reproducibility and scalability. Even with Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF), concerns about data quality remain. Moreover, it is unclear how much data is actually required to fine-tune a base model into a strong instruction-following model. Current approaches often rely on over 300k examples even at the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, yet they still underperform compared to proprietary models, creating barriers for academic and resource-limited communities. To address this gap, we introduce PiKa, a data-efficient family of expert-level alignment datasets. In particular, the PiKa-SFT dataset uses only 30k SFT examples, far fewer than state-of-the-art datasets like Magpie. Through evaluations by fine-tuning Llama-3-8B-Base on PiKa and other public datasets, we show that PiKa-SFT outperforms models trained on much larger data. On AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard benchmarks, PiKa-SFT fine-tuning even surpasses the official Llama-3-8B-Instruct model trained on over 10 million proprietary examples. We further extend our study by training the Qwen2.5 series (0.5B to 7B) on PiKa-SFT, achieving consistent gains. These findings demonstrate that high-quality alignment can be achieved with significantly less data, offering a scalable path for open-source LLM alignment.

## Summary

Here is a summary of the paper "PIKA: Expert-Level Synthetic Datasets for Post-Training Alignment from Scratch":

**Key Contribution:** This paper introduces PiKa, a highly data-efficient family of expert-level synthetic datasets for aligning large language models (LLMs). The core innovation is demonstrating that high-quality alignment can be achieved with orders of magnitude less data than current state-of-the-art methods, using only 30k examples for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and 30k for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), compared to hundreds of thousands used by competitors like Magpie.

**Methods:** The PiKa dataset is constructed through a three-step, persona-driven pipeline:
1.  **Expert-Level Instruction Generation:** GPT-4o is prompted with diverse, complex personas (e.g., from biology, law) sampled from PersonaHub to generate challenging, knowledge-intensive instructions.
2.  **Multi-Path Response Generation:** For each instruction, multiple candidate responses are generated.
3.  **Reward-Model-Guided Selection:** A high-performing reward model (Skywork-Reward) scores the responses. For SFT, the highest-scoring response is selected. For DPO, preference pairs are created from the highest and lowest-scoring responses for the same instruction. This process ensures the dataset is composed of difficult instructions with high-quality, detailed solutions.

**Key Results:**
*   **Superior Performance with Less Data:** When fine-tuning Llama-3-8B, PiKa-SFT (30k examples) outperformed all public baselines, including Magpie-Pro (300k examples), on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard benchmarks.
*   **Beats Official Models:** Remarkably, the PiKa-aligned Llama-3-8B model surpassed the performance of the official **Llama-3-8B-Instruct** (which was trained on over 10M proprietary examples) on both benchmarks.
*   **Generalizes Across Model Families:** The effectiveness of PiKa was validated on the Qwen2.5 model series (0.5B to 7B), where models fine-tuned on PiKa consistently outperformed their official instruction-tuned counterparts.
*   **Effective for Preference Optimization:** When used for DPO, PiKa-based models achieved state-of-the-art results, significantly outperforming models trained on UltraFeedback and Magpie-Pro preference data, especially on the challenging Arena-Hard benchmark (43.70% win rate vs. 33.30% for Magpie-Pro).

In conclusion, PiKa provides a practical and scalable path for advancing open-source LLM alignment by proving that carefully curated, high-quality, and challenging synthetic data is far more impactful than simply scaling dataset size.

## Critique

Of course. Here is a critique of the paper "PIKA: Expert-Level Synthetic Datasets for Post-Training Alignment from Scratch," focusing on its strengths and weaknesses.

### Overall Assessment

This is a strong, well-executed paper that makes a significant and practical contribution to the field of LLM alignment. Its core claim—that a small, high-quality, expert-level synthetic dataset can outperform massive public and even proprietary datasets—is convincingly demonstrated through extensive experiments.

---

### Strengths

1.  **High Novelty and Clear Conceptual Contribution:** The central thesis—**"quality and difficulty over quantity"**—is a powerful and timely counter-narrative to the prevailing trend of massive data scaling for alignment. The idea of using **expert-level personas** to bootstrap the generation of challenging instructions is a clever and effective method to operationalize this concept. This approach directly addresses a key bottleneck for the open-source community.

2.  **Compelling and Significant Results:** The experimental results are the paper's strongest asset. They are comprehensive and leave little room for doubt about PiKa's effectiveness.
    *   **Data Efficiency:** Achieving superior performance with **10x less data** than the current state-of-the-art (Magpie-Pro) is a remarkable result.
    *   **Performance Superiority:** Outperforming the official `Llama-3-8B-Instruct` model (trained on >10M examples) on both AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard is a major milestone for open-source alignment research.
    *   **Generalizability:** The consistent improvements across the Qwen2.5 model family (0.5B to 7B) demonstrate that the value of PiKa is not limited to a single architecture or scale. The scaling analysis (Figure 6) further reinforces the data-efficiency claim.

3.  **Rigorous and Transparent Evaluation:** The paper goes beyond just reporting win rates.
    *   It uses multiple, well-established benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0, Arena-Hard, Open LLM Leaderboard).
    *   It includes both SFT-only and full DPO pipeline results, providing a complete picture.
    *   The dataset analysis (Section 3) is thorough, using both automated metrics (MND, length) and GPT-4o-based evaluation (difficulty, feasibility, quality) to quantitatively justify PiKa's characteristics compared to Magpie-Pro.

4.  **Excellent Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is very well-structured and easy to follow. The writing is clear and concise. Figures are informative and directly support the narrative (e.g., Figure 1's pipeline overview, Figure 4's concrete examples). The use of tables is effective for presenting the core results.

### Weaknesses

1.  **Limited Analysis of "Why" Beyond Difficulty:** While the paper excellently demonstrates *that* PiKa works, the analysis of *why* is somewhat surface-level. It primarily attributes success to "higher difficulty." A deeper investigation could explore:
    *   **Knowledge Activation:** Does training on expert-level prompts better activate or organize the latent knowledge within the base model?
    *   **Reasoning Patterns:** Are the resulting models better at breaking down complex problems, or are they just better at producing longer, more detailed text? The strong performance on Arena-Hard (a reasoning-focused benchmark) suggests the former, but this is not explicitly discussed.
    *   **Transfer Learning:** The claim that learning from hard tasks transfers to easy ones is intuitive but not rigorously tested here with an ablation on simpler benchmarks.

2.  **Potential Over-reliance on GPT-4o:** The entire PiKa pipeline—generation, filtering, and dataset evaluation—relies heavily on GPT-4o. While GPT-4o is a powerful model, this creates a potential "closed loop." There is a risk that the data is optimized for what GPT-4o considers "expert-level," which may not perfectly align with human judgment or generalize to other evaluators. Some human evaluation of the dataset quality would have strengthened the claims.

3.  **Trade-off in General Capabilities:** Table 3 reveals a minor but notable weakness. While PiKa excels at instruction-following, it slightly underperforms the official Llama-3-8B-Instruct and some other datasets on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like MMLU. The authors correctly attribute this to the dataset's composition (e.g., less math/coding), but it highlights a trade-off: specializing in complex instruction-following might come at a small cost to broad factual knowledge recall, unless the base model's knowledge is explicitly reinforced.

4.  **Reproducibility Cost:** Although the method is more data-efficient, it is not necessarily *compute-efficient* for others to reproduce. Generating 30k high-quality examples using GPT-4o (a closed-source, powerful, and likely expensive model) could be a barrier for some academic labs, despite being cheaper than training on 300k examples. The reliance on a specific, high-performing Reward Model (Skywork-Reward) is another potential dependency.

### Conclusion

This is a high-impact paper that successfully challenges the "more data is always better" paradigm in LLM alignment. Its strengths—a novel and well-motivated approach, exceptionally strong and comprehensive results, and clear presentation—far outweigh its weaknesses. The work provides a valuable blueprint and a powerful new resource (the PiKa dataset) for the community, significantly lowering the barrier to achieving state-of-the-art model alignment. The minor weaknesses primarily point to fruitful directions for future research, such as a deeper mechanistic understanding of why expert-level data is so effective and exploring mixtures that also preserve broad knowledge capabilities.

## Abstract

Agents utilizing tools powered by large language models (LLMs) or vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in diverse tasks across text and visual modalities. Unlike traditional tools such as calculators, which give deterministic outputs, neural tools perform uncertainly across task scenarios. While different tools for a task may excel in varied scenarios, existing agents typically rely on fixed tools, thus limiting the flexibility in selecting the most suitable tool for specific tasks. In contrast, humans snowball their understanding of the capabilities of different tools by interacting with them, and apply this knowledge to select the optimal tool when solving a future task. To build agents that similarly benefit from this process, we propose ToolMem that enables agents to develop memories of tool capabilities from previous interactions, by summarizing their strengths and weaknesses and storing them in memory; at inference, the agent can retrieve relevant entries from ToolMem, and select the best tool to solve individual tasks more accurately. We evaluate ToolMem on learning varied text generation and text-to-image generation neural tools. Compared to no-memory, generic agents, we find ToolMem-augmented agents predict tool performance 14.8% and 28.7% more accurately across text and multimodal generation scenarios. Moreover, ToolMem facilitates optimal tool selection among multiple choices by 21% and 24% absolute increases in respective scenarios.

## Summary

Based on the provided paper, here is a summary focusing on its key contributions, methods, and results:

**Key Contributions:**
This paper introduces ToolMem, a novel framework designed to enhance multimodal agents by equipping them with a learnable, structured memory of tool capabilities. The core contribution is enabling agents to dynamically build, update, and retrieve knowledge about the strengths and weaknesses of various generative AI tools (e.g., text and image generation models) from past interaction experiences. This allows agents to make more informed decisions by selecting the most suitable tool for a given task, moving beyond the current paradigm of using fixed, pre-designated tools with only static descriptions.

**Methods:**
The ToolMem framework operates through three main components:
1.  **Structured Memory Initialization:** A memory is initialized for each tool, structured around a taxonomy of proficiency levels (e.g., "proficient at," "good at," "bad at").
2.  **Learning from Experiences:** The agent interacts with tools on tasks, receives feedback (e.g., human annotations or LLM-as-a-judge scores), and uses a memory induction module (an LM) to summarize these experiences into natural language capability entries. A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism is used to update the memory, which involves retrieving relevant past entries and refining/consolidating them with new insights to avoid redundancy.
3.  **Task Solving with Retrieved Memory:** For a new task, the agent retrieves the most relevant capability entries from its ToolMem and uses this context to either predict a tool's performance or select the best-performing tool from a set of candidates.

**Results:**
The framework was evaluated on text generation (using BiGGen Bench) and text-to-image generation (using GenAI-Bench) tasks.
*   **Tool Performance Prediction:** ToolMem-augmented agents significantly outperformed a Generic agent (with no prior tool knowledge) and a Few-Shot baseline (which retrieves raw past examples). It reduced the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in score prediction by **14.8%** (text) and **28.7%** (image) on average. The improvements were particularly pronounced for weaker or smaller models, where prior knowledge was initially lacking.
*   **Performant Tool Selection:** When tasked with choosing the better tool from a pair, ToolMem achieved an absolute accuracy improvement of **21%** (text) and **24%** (image) over the Generic agent. It consistently outperformed baselines across various tool pairings, demonstrating its ability to leverage learned capability memories for optimal tool selection.

## Critique

Here is a critique of the paper "ToolMem: Enhancing Multimodal Agents with Learnable Tool Capability Memory":

### Strengths

**Novelty and Approach:**
- The paper introduces a novel framework (ToolMem) for building dynamic, learnable memory of tool capabilities in multimodal agents. This addresses a significant gap in existing agent systems that typically use fixed tools without understanding their nuanced strengths and weaknesses.
- The structured memory initialization with proficiency-level taxonomy (proficient/good/bad/weak) and the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for memory refinement are technically sound innovations.
- The approach of learning from interaction experiences rather than relying solely on static tool descriptions represents a meaningful advancement toward more adaptive AI systems.

**Significance of Results:**
- The experimental results are substantial and convincing, demonstrating consistent improvements across both text generation (BiGGen Bench) and text-to-image generation (GenAI-Bench) tasks.
- The 14.8-28.7% improvement in tool performance prediction accuracy and 21-24% absolute improvement in optimal tool selection represent significant practical advances.
- The analysis shows particularly strong benefits for weaker/mid-tier models, which is important for real-world deployment where access to top-tier proprietary models may be limited.

**Presentation and Methodology:**
- The paper is well-structured with clear progression from problem formulation to solution design and comprehensive evaluation.
- The dual evaluation approach (performance prediction and tool selection) provides thorough validation of the framework's utility.
- The comparison against both generic and few-shot baselines establishes appropriate benchmarks for assessing the method's effectiveness.

### Weaknesses

**Technical Limitations:**
- The approach relies heavily on the quality of the initial feedback system (human annotations or LLM-as-judge), which could introduce biases or inaccuracies that propagate through the memory system.
- The memory update mechanism, while sophisticated, may face scalability challenges as the number of tools and experiences grows significantly.
- The paper doesn't sufficiently address potential issues with conflicting or outdated memory entries in long-term deployment.

**Experimental Scope:**
- Evaluation is limited to text and image generation tasks; broader application to other modalities (audio, video) or different types of tools (e.g., reasoning, planning tools) remains unexplored.
- The tool selection experiments focus on pairwise comparisons; real-world scenarios often involve selecting from larger tool sets, which may present additional challenges.

**Presentation Issues:**
- The memory initialization process and the specific prompts used for memory induction could be described more clearly, potentially affecting reproducibility.
- Some experimental details (e.g., specific hyperparameter choices, computational requirements) are somewhat buried in the appendices.
- The discussion of limitations in Section E is relatively brief and could benefit from more thorough treatment of potential failure modes and edge cases.

### Overall Assessment

This paper presents a well-conceived and thoroughly evaluated framework that addresses an important challenge in multimodal agent systems. The novelty of the approach, combined with strong empirical results across multiple benchmarks, makes a valuable contribution to the field. While some technical and scalability questions remain open, the work demonstrates clear practical benefits and provides a solid foundation for future research in adaptive tool-using agents. The presentation is generally clear and professional, though some methodological details could be more accessible for replication purposes.

## Abstract

Automating the end-to-end scientific research process poses a fundamental challenge: it requires both evolving high-level plans that are novel and sound, and executing these plans correctly amidst dynamic and uncertain conditions. To address this bilevel challenge, we propose a novel Double-Loop Multi-Agent (DLMA) framework to solve the given research problem automatically. The leader loop, composed of professor agents, is responsible for evolving research plans. It employs an evolutionary algorithm through involvement, improvement, and integration meetings to iteratively generate and refine a pool of research proposals, exploring the solution space effectively. The follower loop, composed of doctoral student agents, is responsible for executing the best-evolved plan. It dynamically adjusts the plan during implementation via pre-hoc and post-hoc meetings, ensuring each step (e.g., drafting, coding) is well-supported by contextual and external observations. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like ACLAward and Laboratory show that DLMA generates research papers that achieve state-of-the-art scores in automated evaluation, significantly outperforming strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm the critical roles of both loops, with evolution driving novelty and execution ensuring soundness.

## Summary

This paper introduces the **Double-Loop Multi-Agent (DLMA) framework** for automated scientific research, addressing the dual challenge of generating novel research plans and ensuring their reliable execution. The key contribution is a bilevel optimization approach where the **leader loop** (composed of professor agents) evolves research proposals through evolutionary meetings (involvement, improvement, and integration) to explore the solution space, while the **follower loop** (composed of doctoral student agents) dynamically executes the best plan using pre-hoc and post-hoc meetings to align actions with contextual and external observations.

The method employs a population-based evolutionary strategy in the leader loop to iteratively refine proposals, with a review panel guiding selection. The follower loop ensures plan fidelity by continuously updating the to-do list based on execution feedback, maintaining consistency between the plan and emerging results. Experiments on benchmarks like ACLAward and Laboratory show that DLMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines including GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and multi-agent systems like CycleResearcher and Agent Laboratory. Ablation studies confirm that the leader loop drives novelty (exciting contributions) and the follower loop ensures soundness (technical solidity), with both components being critical for overall success. However, the framework incurs significant computational costs, highlighting a trade-off between performance and efficiency.

## Critique

Of course. Here is a critique of the paper "Evolving and Executing Research Plans via Double-Loop Multi-Agent Collaboration," focusing on its strengths and weaknesses.

### Strengths

1.  **Novel and Well-Motivated Conceptual Framework:** The paper's core strength is its compelling framing of automated scientific research as a **bilevel optimization problem**. This provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for the two-pronged challenge of "doing the right things" (planning) and "doing things right" (execution). The inspiration from **double-loop learning** and organizational theory is innovative and provides a strong, human-analogous justification for the two-loop architecture, distinguishing it from more ad-hoc multi-agent systems.

2.  **Comprehensive and Detailed Methodology:** The proposed DLMA framework is described with exceptional clarity and depth. The breakdown of the leader loop (professor agents) into involvement, improvement, and integration meetings provides a clear, evolutionary algorithm-inspired mechanism for exploring the research solution space. Similarly, the follower loop's (doctoral student agents) use of pre-hoc and post-hoc meetings to dynamically align the plan with contextual and external observations is a sophisticated solution to the problem of plan execution under uncertainty.

3.  **Rigorous and Extensive Experimental Design:** The evaluation is thorough and well-designed. The use of three distinct benchmarks (**ACLAward**, **Laboratory**, **Plagiarism**) allows for testing on high-quality, contemporary, and integrity-focused research problems, respectively. The comparison against both powerful base LLMs and state-of-the-art multi-agent frameworks (CycleResearcher, Agent Laboratory, Dolphin) is comprehensive. The inclusion of a meta-evaluation correlating LLM-judge scores with human expert rankings adds credibility to the automated evaluation method.

4.  **Insightful Ablation and Analysis:** The paper goes beyond mere performance reporting. The ablation study effectively isolates the contributions of the leader (evolution) and follower (adaptation) loops, showing that evolution drives "Excitement/Contribution" while adaptation ensures "Soundness." The additional analyses on proposal quality over generations (Section 4.4) and the support rate of the to-do list (Section 4.5) provide valuable, data-driven insights into the internal workings of the framework.

### Weaknesses

1.  **Significant Computational Cost:** The most prominent weakness is the **prohibitive computational cost**. As detailed in Table 4, the full DLMA framework requires ~1,558 seconds and ~1.75 million tokens per run. This limits its practical accessibility and raises questions about its scalability and environmental impact, a point the authors rightly acknowledge in the limitations section.

2.  **Over-reliance on LLM-as-Judge:** While the use of LLM-as-a-judge is a pragmatic and increasingly standard approach, it remains a significant weakness. Despite the reported correlation with human judgment (0.46), this is not a perfect substitute for peer review by domain experts. The evaluation could be strengthened by a more detailed qualitative analysis of a few generated papers by human researchers to assess the true novelty, depth, and correctness of the proposed "scientific contributions."

3.  **Limited Demonstration of True Scientific Novelty:** The case studies, while illustrative, highlight a key limitation. In the first case, the DLMA system identifies an appropriate technique (ALTI) but fails to match the human expert's incorporation of more advanced methods (LPR, AAttnLRP). This suggests that while the framework is excellent at synthesizing and executing on *existing* ideas, its ability to generate genuinely **novel, groundbreaking scientific concepts** that go beyond the sum of its retrieved references is not yet fully demonstrated. The system seems better at competent research synthesis than paradigm-shifting discovery.

4.  **Ambiguity in "Convergence" and Bottlenecks:** The paper mentions that evolution plateaus after a few generations, hitting a "bottleneck." However, the explanation for this bottleneck is somewhat vague. Is it a fundamental limitation of the underlying LLM's knowledge and reasoning capabilities? Is it an issue with the evolutionary operators (meetings) themselves? A deeper discussion of what causes this plateau and how it might be overcome in future work would be valuable.

### Summary

This paper presents a highly novel, rigorously designed, and thoroughly evaluated framework for automated scientific research. The double-loop multi-agent architecture is a significant conceptual advance that effectively addresses the dual challenges of planning and execution. The results are impressive and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

The primary weaknesses lie in its substantial computational demands and the inherent limitations of evaluating scientific output primarily through automated metrics. The work is a powerful proof-of-concept that pushes the boundaries of what is possible with AI in science, but it also clearly delineates the current frontiers, particularly regarding true novelty and cost-effective application.

# SID: Multi-LLM Debate Driven by Self Signals

Authors: Xuhang Chen, Zhifan Song, Deyi Ji, Shuo Gao, Lanyun Zhu

Keywords: Multi-agent debate, Self signals, Model-level confidence, Token-level semantic focus, Early-exit mechanism, Adaptive compression, Efficiency optimization

## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across diverse application domains. Recent work has explored Multi-LLM Agent Debate (MAD) as a way to enhance performance by enabling multiple LLMs to discuss and refine responses iteratively. Nevertheless, existing MAD methods predominantly focus on utilizing external structures, such as debate graphs, using LLM-as-a-Judge, while neglecting the application of self signals, such as token logits and attention, that arise during generation. This omission leads to redundant computation and potential performance degradation. In this paper, we shift the focus to the self signals of multi-LLM debate and introduce a Self-Signals Driven Multi-LLM Debate (SID), which leverages two types of self-signals: model-level confidence and token-level semantic focus, to adaptively guide the debate process. Our approach enables high-confidence agents to exit early at the model level and compress the redundant debate contents based on the attention mechanism. We evaluate our method on various LLMs and Multimodal LLMs across multiple challenging benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only outperforms existing MAD techniques in accuracy but also reduces token consumption, highlighting the effectiveness of utilizing self signals in enhancing both the performance and efficiency of multi-agent debate systems. Our code will be available at~\href{https://github.com/xuhang2019/SID}{\texttt{https://github.com/xuhang2019/SID}}.

## Summary

Here is a summary of the paper "SID: Multi-LLM Debate Driven by Self Signals":

**Key Contributions:** This paper introduces SID (Self-Signals Driven Multi-LLM Debate), a novel framework that leverages internal signals from LLMs' generation processes to enhance multi-agent debate systems. The key innovation is shifting from traditional external mechanisms (like debate graphs or LLM-as-judge) to utilizing two types of self-signals: model-level confidence and token-level semantic focus. This approach addresses the critical limitations of existing Multi-LLM Agent Debate (MAD) methods, which suffer from redundant computations, token inefficiency, and potential performance degradation due to error-prone external mechanisms.

**Methods:** SID integrates two complementary mechanisms: (1) An early-exit mechanism based on model-level confidence, derived from token-wise uncertainty metrics (entropy and negative log-likelihood) aggregated into sequence-level confidence scores. This allows confident agents to exit early, avoiding unnecessary debate. The framework employs a vocabulary-adaptive threshold to ensure fair comparison across models with different vocabulary sizes. (2) An adaptive compression mechanism using token-level semantic focus, where attention patterns conditioned on disagreement-oriented prompts identify semantically relevant spans in debate content. These high-attention spans are reconstructed into compact contexts while preserving critical points of contention, significantly reducing token overhead.

**Results:** Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs (LLaMA-3.1-8B, GPT-OSS-20B) and MLLMs (LLaVA1.6-13B, GLM4.1V) on diverse benchmarks (MMLUpro, Math, GPQA, ScienceQA, MMStar) demonstrate that SID consistently outperforms existing MAD approaches in accuracy while achieving up to 40% reduction in token consumption. The framework shows strong scalability with additional debate rounds and maintains robust performance across different model types. Ablation studies confirm the importance of both key components, with semantic preservation being particularly crucial for maintaining coherent compressed contexts.

## Critique

Of course. Here is a critique of the paper "SID: Multi-LLM Debate Driven by Self Signals."

### Summary

The paper "SID" proposes a novel framework to enhance Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) by leveraging internal "self-signals" from LLMs—specifically, model-level confidence (from output logits) and token-level semantic focus (from attention maps)—to improve both performance and efficiency. The method introduces an early-exit mechanism for confident agents and an adaptive compression technique for debate history, achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks while significantly reducing token consumption.

---

### Strengths

1.  **High Novelty and Conceptual Contribution:** The core idea of using *internal, generation-time signals* (logits and attention) instead of relying solely on *external* mechanisms (like LLM-as-a-judge or structural prompts) is a significant and clever shift in the MAD paradigm. This addresses a known weakness of existing methods: the potential for secondary errors and hallucinations introduced by summary or judge agents.

2.  **Comprehensive and Well-Designed Methodology:** The proposed framework is elegant and well-motivated. The two key components are complementary:
    *   **Early-Exit with Model-Level Confidence:** The use of a "vocabulary-adaptive threshold" is a simple yet effective solution to the problem of confidence calibration across models with different vocabulary sizes.
    *   **Adaptive Compression with Semantic Focus:** Using attention maps conditioned on a disagreement prompt to identify and preserve salient parts of the debate is innovative. The `SemanticPreserve` heuristic to maintain coherent text spans is a crucial practical detail that moves beyond naive token selection.

3.  **Strong and Convincing Empirical Results:** The paper provides extensive experiments across multiple models (LLMs and MLLMs) and diverse benchmarks (MMLUpro, Math, ScienceQA, MMStar). The results consistently show that SID outperforms strong baselines like MAD and DMAD in accuracy while achieving up to a **40% reduction in token consumption**. This dual improvement in performance and efficiency is a powerful result.

4.  **Thorough Ablation and Analysis:** The paper includes a rigorous ablation study (Table 3) that clearly demonstrates the contribution of each component (early-exit, compression, semantic preservation). The analysis of hyperparameters `α` and `p` (Figure 2e,f) provides practical guidance for implementation. The statistical significance tests and case studies (Figure 3) further solidify the claims.

5.  **Excellent Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is exceptionally well-written and structured. The problem is clearly motivated, the method is explained step-by-step with the aid of an algorithm box (Algorithm 1) and a framework diagram (Figure 1), and the results are presented logically. The inclusion of a "Reproducibility Statement" and detailed appendices is a commendable practice.

---

### Weaknesses

1.  **Computational Overhead of Attention Extraction:** While SID saves tokens, it introduces a new computational cost: a full forward pass to extract attention maps for compression. The paper mentions this is a "forward only" operation, which is cheaper than a full generation, but the overall computational trade-off (FLOPs vs. tokens) is not quantitatively compared to baselines. For very long debates, this overhead could become non-negligible.

2.  **Hyperparameter Sensitivity and Generalizability:** The optimal values for key hyperparameters like the threshold `α` and the compression ratio `p` are found empirically and seem to vary based on the model type (e.g., `α=1.0` for reasoning models, `0.5` for general-purpose). This suggests that some tuning is required for new models or tasks, which could limit the "out-of-the-box" applicability. The paper could have investigated a more adaptive method for setting these parameters.

3.  **Limited Exploration of "Hard" Debates:** The framework excels at filtering out easy questions (via early exit) and compressing redundant debates. However, it would be valuable to see a deeper analysis of its performance on questions that are inherently ambiguous or where agents have fundamentally conflicting but reasonable viewpoints. Does the compression mechanism risk filtering out nuanced, low-attention but critical counter-arguments in such "hard" debates?

4.  **Comparison to Recent SOTA:** While comparisons to MAD and DMAD are solid, it would strengthen the paper to compare against other recent, efficient collaborative reasoning methods, if any exist at the time of publication. The bar for "efficiency" in multi-agent systems is rapidly rising.

---

### Overall Assessment

This is a high-quality paper that makes a substantial contribution to the field of multi-agent systems and efficient LLM reasoning. The core idea is novel and impactful, the methodology is sound and well-engineered, and the empirical evidence is comprehensive and convincing. The weaknesses are minor and primarily point to interesting directions for future work rather than flaws in the current contribution. The significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency make SID a compelling and practical advancement over existing Multi-LLM Debate techniques.
