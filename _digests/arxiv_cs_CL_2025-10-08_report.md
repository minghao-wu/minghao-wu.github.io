Today's research landscape reveals a strong emphasis on multi-agent collaboration frameworks, with several papers proposing innovative architectures that combine specialized agents for complex reasoning and execution tasks. A notable trend is the integration of **stateful inference-time search** to overcome the limitations of stateless approaches, enabling persistent memory across reasoning steps. Researchers are increasingly leveraging **self-signals**—internal model states like token logits and attention patterns—to enhance both performance and efficiency in multi-agent systems, moving beyond traditional external mechanisms. In multilingual contexts, **consistency-enhanced reinforcement learning** is emerging as a powerful technique to bridge the performance gap between English and non-English languages, while dedicated human-in-the-loop pipelines are being developed to create culturally-grounded datasets for underrepresented languages. These developments collectively advance automated scientific research capabilities through **double-loop multi-agent (DLMA)** frameworks that simultaneously evolve high-level plans and ensure reliable execution, marking significant progress in making AI systems more capable, efficient, and globally inclusive.

## TL;DR

Here's a TL;DR summary of the key themes and insights from these papers:

**Multi-Agent Collaboration & Stateful Reasoning**
Recent research shows significant advances in multi-agent frameworks that maintain persistent state during inference. The paper on stateful multi-agent evolutionary search (https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07147) demonstrates how combining persistent state with evolutionary algorithms improves complex reasoning tasks like unit test generation. Similarly, the double-loop framework (https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06761) separates plan evolution ("professor" agents) from execution ("student" agents) for automated scientific research, achieving state-of-the-art results.

**Efficiency through Self-Signals & Internal Model States**
The SID framework (https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06843) introduces a novel approach using internal model signals (confidence scores and attention patterns) to optimize multi-agent debates, achieving both performance gains and up to 40% token reduction. This represents a shift from external orchestration to leveraging models' internal states for efficiency.

**Multilingual & Cross-Cultural Adaptation**
Two papers address multilingual challenges: M-Thinker (https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07300) uses reinforcement learning with cross-lingual alignment to transfer reasoning capabilities from English to other languages while maintaining language consistency. Pragyaan (https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07000) tackles cultural grounding for Indian languages through human-in-the-loop dataset curation, emphasizing cultural nuance beyond mere translation.

**Common Insights**: These papers collectively show a trend toward more sophisticated multi-agent architectures that combine specialized roles, persistent state management, and efficient internal signal utilization. They address critical challenges in reasoning consistency, multilingual performance, and computational efficiency while maintaining or improving task performance.

## Abstract

Recent work explores agentic inference-time techniques to perform structured, multi-step reasoning. However, stateless inference often struggles on multi-step tasks due to the absence of persistent state. Moreover, task-specific fine-tuning or instruction-tuning often achieve surface-level code generation but remain brittle on tasks requiring deeper reasoning and long-horizon dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose stateful multi-agent evolutionary search, a training-free framework that departs from prior stateless approaches by combining (i) persistent inference-time state, (ii) adversarial mutation, and (iii) evolutionary preservation. We demonstrate its effectiveness in automated unit test generation through the generation of edge cases. We generate robust edge cases using an evolutionary search process, where specialized agents sequentially propose, mutate, and score candidates. A controller maintains persistent state across generations, while evolutionary preservation ensures diversity and exploration across all possible cases. This yields a generalist agent capable of discovering robust, high-coverage edge cases across unseen codebases. Experiments show our stateful multi-agent inference framework achieves substantial gains in coverage over stateless single-step baselines, evaluated on prevalent unit-testing benchmarks such as HumanEval and TestGenEvalMini and using three diverse LLM families - Llama, Gemma, and GPT. These results indicate that combining persistent inference-time state with evolutionary search materially improves unit-test generation.

## Summary

This paper introduces a stateful multi-agent evolutionary framework for automated unit test generation, addressing limitations of stateless inference approaches in complex reasoning tasks. The key contribution is a training-free system that combines persistent inference-time state with evolutionary search to generate robust edge cases and unit tests.

The methodology employs four specialized agents orchestrated by a controller: an Actor proposes candidate edge cases, an Adversary generates program mutants to test robustness, a Critic integrates coverage metrics and mutation scores into rewards, and an Executor provides sandboxed evaluation. The framework maintains persistent state across evolutionary stages, allowing later iterations to build upon previous discoveries. A notable feature is the cold-start initialization using rule-based heuristics, which often produces high-quality results without requiring LLM calls.

Experiments on HumanEval and TestGenEvalMini benchmarks using Llama-70B, GPT-o4-mini, and Gemma-2-27B models demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms few-shot and chain-of-thought baselines in line and function coverage. While branch coverage showed some variability across models, the system achieved substantial improvements in test quality, particularly on the more complex TestGenEvalMini dataset. The framework resolved 62% of HumanEval problems in a single iteration while requiring multiple iterations for more challenging tasks, demonstrating effective scaling with computational investment.

The results highlight the promise of stateful multi-agent coordination for enhancing reasoning capabilities without model fine-tuning, though the authors acknowledge computational costs and potential for improved branch coverage as areas for future work.

## Critique

Of course. Here is a critique of the paper "A Multi-Agent Framework for Stateful Inference-Time Search," focusing on its strengths and weaknesses.

### Strengths

1.  **Novel and Well-Motivated Core Idea:** The paper's central thesis—that **stateful, multi-agent evolutionary search** at inference time can outperform stateless prompting for complex reasoning tasks—is both timely and compelling. It addresses a well-known limitation of current LLM inference (the lack of persistent state) in a concrete and impactful domain (unit test generation).
2.  **Comprehensive Framework Design:** The proposed architecture is thoughtfully decomposed. The roles of the **Actor, Adversary, Critic, Executor, and Controller** are clearly defined and work in a logical synergy. The inclusion of an **Adversary** for mutation testing is a particularly strong point, as it grounds the search in a robust, software engineering-specific notion of test quality beyond simple code coverage.
3.  **Rigorous and Realistic Evaluation:** The choice of benchmarks is excellent. Using the well-known but simpler HumanEval as a sanity check and introducing a more complex, real-world-derived **TestGenEvalMini** dataset provides a nuanced view of the method's performance. The results convincingly show that the method's advantage is most pronounced on complex, real-world code, which is its intended use case.
4.  **Training-Free Approach:** A significant practical strength is that the framework is entirely **training-free**. It leverages existing, off-the-shelf LLMs, making it more accessible and easier to deploy compared to methods requiring fine-tuning or reinforcement learning.
5.  **Clarity and Reproducibility:** The paper is generally well-written. Key components like the state representation, reward function, and algorithm are presented with formal definitions and pseudo-code. The inclusion of extensive appendices covering prompts, computational costs, and examples enhances reproducibility.

### Weaknesses

1.  **Limited Analysis of Computational Cost:** While the paper acknowledges higher inference costs and includes an appendix on FLOPs, this critical limitation is not deeply analyzed in the main text. A discussion of the trade-off between improved coverage and the significant increase in runtime/API calls would strengthen the practical evaluation. Figure 3 shows a "steep" runtime increase, but quantifying this (e.g., average cost multiplier over baselines) is missing.
2.  **Superficial Treatment of Mixed Branch Coverage Results:** The results for GPT-o4-mini and Gemma-2-27B on branch coverage are a notable caveat. The explanation provided—that the search may favor exception-heavy paths—is plausible but remains a hypothesis. A deeper analysis (e.g., qualitative examples of generated tests, analysis of the reward function's bias) would have been valuable to understand and address this weakness.
3.  **Novelty in the Context of Multi-Agent Systems:** The paper positions itself against "ad-hoc orchestration" in prior multi-agent systems. While the specific combination with evolutionary search and adversarial grounding is novel, a more detailed comparison of how the "state" in this work differs from or improves upon the memory/reflection mechanisms in cited works like AI Co-scientist or AlphaEvolve would sharpen the contribution claim.
4.  **Clarity of the "Cold-Start":** The "cold-start" mechanism using rule-based heuristics is a key efficiency feature, responsible for solving 62% of HumanEval problems without LLM calls. However, the description of these heuristics is relegated to an appendix and is somewhat vague ("boundary partition analysis, equivalence classes, and stress conditions"). A more detailed explanation in the main methodology section would improve clarity.
5.  **Presentation of Figures:** The labels in Figures 2, 3, etc., are referenced as "Refer to caption," but the captions themselves in the provided text are minimal ("Figure 2: Final edge case quality..."). More descriptive captions that explain what each line/bar represents would make the figures easier to interpret without constantly referring back to the main text.

### Overall Assessment

This is a **strong paper** with a significant contribution. It presents a novel, well-engineered framework that effectively tackles a clear problem in LLM reasoning. The experimental results are compelling, especially on the more challenging TestGenEvalMini benchmark, and the training-free nature is a major practical advantage. The main weaknesses lie in a more thorough analysis of computational trade-offs and a deeper dive into the nuances of the results, particularly the branch coverage discrepancy. The core ideas are likely to influence future work on stateful inference and multi-agent systems for code generation.

# SID: Multi-LLM Debate Driven by Self Signals

Authors: Xuhang Chen, Zhifan Song, Deyi Ji, Shuo Gao, Lanyun Zhu

Keywords: multi-agent debate, self-signals, LLM confidence, attention compression, early-exit mechanisms

Comments: None

## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across diverse application domains. Recent work has explored Multi-LLM Agent Debate (MAD) as a way to enhance performance by enabling multiple LLMs to discuss and refine responses iteratively. Nevertheless, existing MAD methods predominantly focus on utilizing external structures, such as debate graphs, using LLM-as-a-Judge, while neglecting the application of self signals, such as token logits and attention, that arise during generation. This omission leads to redundant computation and potential performance degradation. In this paper, we shift the focus to the self signals of multi-LLM debate and introduce a Self-Signals Driven Multi-LLM Debate (SID), which leverages two types of self-signals: model-level confidence and token-level semantic focus, to adaptively guide the debate process. Our approach enables high-confidence agents to exit early at the model level and compress the redundant debate contents based on the attention mechanism. We evaluate our method on various LLMs and Multimodal LLMs across multiple challenging benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only outperforms existing MAD techniques in accuracy but also reduces token consumption, highlighting the effectiveness of utilizing self signals in enhancing both the performance and efficiency of multi-agent debate systems. Our code will be available at~\href{https://github.com/xuhang2019/SID}{\texttt{https://github.com/xuhang2019/SID}}.

## Summary

Here is a summary of the paper "SID: Multi-LLM Debate Driven by Self Signals":

**Key Contribution:** This paper introduces SID, a novel multi-LLM debate framework that leverages internal "self signals" from LLM generation processes to enhance both performance and efficiency, breaking away from traditional reliance on external mechanisms like debate graphs or LLM-as-a-judge.

**Method:** SID utilizes two types of self signals:
1. **Model-level confidence:** Derived from token-wise output probability distributions (entropy and negative log-likelihood), enabling an early-exit mechanism where confident agents can terminate debate early. The paper introduces a vocabulary-adaptive threshold to handle different model vocabulary sizes.
2. **Token-level semantic focus:** Extracted from attention patterns conditioned on disagreement-oriented prompts, allowing adaptive compression of debate history by preserving only semantically relevant spans that capture key points of contention.

The framework integrates these mechanisms to dynamically guide the debate process - early-exit prevents unnecessary discussions for confident cases, while compression reduces token redundancy in remaining debates.

**Results:** Experiments across multiple benchmarks (MMLUpro, Math, GPQA, ScienceQA, MMstar) and models (LLaMA-3.1-8B, GPT-OSS-20B, LLaVA1.6-13B, GLM4.1V) demonstrate that SID consistently outperforms existing multi-agent debate methods while achieving up to 40% reduction in token consumption. The method shows strong scalability with additional debate rounds and maintains robust performance across both LLM and multimodal LLM tasks.

The work highlights the significant potential of leveraging internal model states for optimizing multi-agent collaborative systems, offering a more efficient and effective alternative to traditional external debate mechanisms.

## Critique

Of course. Here is a critique of the paper "SID: Multi-LLM Debate Driven by Self Signals," covering its strengths, weaknesses, novelty, and clarity.

### Overall Summary

This paper presents a well-motivated and empirically solid contribution to the field of multi-agent systems for LLMs. It addresses a clear and practical problem—the inefficiency and redundancy of multi-agent debates—with a novel solution based on the model's internal "self signals." The results are significant, demonstrating consistent performance improvements alongside substantial reductions in computational cost.

---

### Strengths

1.  **Novel and Well-Motivated Core Idea:** The central premise—leveraging the model's own generation-time signals (logits and attention) instead of relying on an external "LLM-as-a-judge"—is highly innovative. This shift avoids secondary errors from summarization or judgment hallucinations and taps into a previously underutilized source of information. The idea is both elegant and pragmatic.

2.  **Comprehensive Dual-Mechanism Design:** The paper doesn't rely on a single trick but introduces two complementary mechanisms:
    *   **Model-Level Confidence for Early-Exit:** This is a simple yet powerful idea. The vocabulary-adaptive threshold is a particularly clever solution to the problem of comparing confidence across models with different vocabularies.
    *   **Token-Level Semantic Focus for Compression:** Using attention maps conditioned on a disagreement prompt to identify and compress salient parts of the debate is a sophisticated and effective method for reducing redundancy while preserving critical information.

3.  **Extensive and Convincing Evaluation:** The experimental setup is thorough. The authors evaluate across multiple model types (LLMs and MLLMs), model scales (8B to 20B), and diverse, challenging benchmarks (MMLUpro, Math, ScienceQA, etc.). The fact that SID consistently outperforms strong baselines like MAD and DMAD in both accuracy and token efficiency (up to 40% reduction) is a compelling result.

4.  **Excellent Ablation Studies:** The paper includes rigorous ablation studies that clearly demonstrate the contribution of each component (early-exit, compression, semantic preservation). The analysis of hyperparameters `α` and `p` provides practical guidance for implementation.

5.  **Clear and Well-Structured Presentation:** The paper is logically organized, with a clear introduction, method, and experiments. The use of a system diagram (Figure 1) and a detailed algorithm (Algorithm 1) makes the proposed framework easy to understand. The case studies in the visualization section are effective for intuitive understanding.

### Weaknesses and Potential Concerns

1.  **Limited Scale and Model Diversity:** While the paper tests on a good range of models, the largest model used is 20B parameters. It is crucial to validate whether these self-signal-based mechanisms scale effectively and remain reliable with state-of-the-art models of 70B+ parameters, where confidence calibration and attention patterns might differ.

2.  **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The performance of SID is dependent on key hyperparameters like the threshold `α` and the compression ratio `p`. The paper shows that these need to be tuned, as suboptimal values can degrade performance. This could be a practical hurdle for deployment, though the authors do provide recommended starting points.

3.  **Overstated Claim of Independence from External Mechanisms:** The token-level compression mechanism still relies on an **external prompt** ("Identify the key points where they disagree...") to condition the attention. While this is much lighter than an LLM-as-a-judge, it is not purely "self-signal" driven in the same way the logits-based confidence is. The approach is best described as minimizing, not eliminating, reliance on external mechanisms.

4.  **Unexplored Interaction with Reasoning Styles:** The paper notes that "thinking models" like GPT-OSS show different compression characteristics but doesn't deeply analyze why. A more thorough investigation into how different model architectures and pre-training objectives (e.g., chain-of-thought fine-tuned models) affect the reliability of these self-signals would be valuable future work.

5.  **Clarity on the "Calibrated Confidence" Method:** The description of the lightweight classifier `C` for calibrated confidence is somewhat brief. It's unclear what architecture was used, the size of the training set, and whether this held-out set introduces data leakage concerns or limits the generalizability of SID-c compared to the training-free SID-v.

### Assessment of Novelty, Significance, and Clarity

*   **Novelty:** **High.** The core idea of using token logits and prompt-conditioned attention as dynamic control signals for a multi-agent debate framework is, to the best of my knowledge, novel. It provides a distinct and orthogonal direction for improving multi-agent systems compared to prior work focused on graph structures or role-playing.
*   **Significance:** **High.** The paper tackles the critical problem of computational cost in complex LLM applications. Achieving higher accuracy with significantly lower token consumption is a result of great practical significance for making advanced reasoning techniques more accessible and cost-effective.
*   **Clarity:** **Very Good.** The paper is well-written, logically structured, and supported by clear diagrams, algorithms, and tables. The methodology is described in sufficient detail for comprehension and, as noted in the reproducibility statement, for replication.

### Conclusion

"SID" is a strong paper that introduces a novel and effective framework for efficient multi-agent debate. Its strengths in motivation, design, and empirical validation far outweigh its minor weaknesses. The work makes a valuable contribution by opening up a new research direction focused on internal model states for guiding collaboration, with immediate practical benefits in performance and cost savings.

# Think Natively: Unlocking Multilingual Reasoning with Consistency-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning

Authors: Xue Zhang, Yunlong Liang, Fandong Meng, Songming Zhang, Kaiyu Huang, Yufeng Chen, Jinan Xu, Jie Zhou

Keywords: Multilingual Reasoning, Reinforcement Learning, Language Consistency, Cross-lingual Alignment, Math Reasoning, Large Reasoning Models, GRPO

Comments: 13 pages, 8 tables, 4 figures

Paper link: [http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07300v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07300v1)

## Abstract

Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks by adopting the "think-then-answer" paradigm, which enhances both accuracy and interpretability. However, current LRMs exhibit two critical limitations when processing non-English languages: (1) They often struggle to maintain input-output language consistency; (2) They generally perform poorly with wrong reasoning paths and lower answer accuracy compared to English. These limitations significantly degrade the user experience for non-English speakers and hinder the global deployment of LRMs. To address these limitations, we propose M-Thinker, which is trained by the GRPO algorithm that involves a Language Consistency (LC) reward and a novel Cross-lingual Thinking Alignment (CTA) reward. Specifically, the LC reward defines a strict constraint on the language consistency between the input, thought, and answer. Besides, the CTA reward compares the model's non-English reasoning paths with its English reasoning path to transfer its own reasoning capability from English to non-English languages. Through an iterative RL procedure, our M-Thinker-1.5B/7B models not only achieve nearly 100% language consistency and superior performance on two multilingual benchmarks (MMATH and PolyMath), but also exhibit excellent generalization on out-of-domain languages.

## Summary

Here is a summary of the paper "Think Natively: Unlocking Multilingual Reasoning with Consistency-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning":

**Key Contributions:**
This paper addresses two critical limitations of current Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) in multilingual scenarios: (1) poor input-output language consistency, where models often default to English reasoning even for non-English inputs, and (2) inferior reasoning performance for non-English languages compared to English. The authors propose M-Thinker, a framework that enhances multilingual reasoning through consistency-enhanced reinforcement learning.

**Methods:**
The core innovation lies in two carefully designed rewards within the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) framework:
1. **Language Consistency (LC) Reward**: A strict constraint that enforces the model to generate both reasoning and answer sequences in the same language as the input.
2. **Cross-lingual Thinking Alignment (CTA) Reward**: A novel reward that compares non-English reasoning paths with the model's own English reasoning paths, transferring reasoning capabilities from English to other languages.

The training procedure involves cold-start supervised fine-tuning, rejection sampling to select challenging problems, and iterative RL training. The overall reward combines format correctness, accuracy, language consistency, and cross-lingual alignment.

**Results:**
Experiments on MMATH and PolyMath benchmarks show that M-Thinker-1.5B/7B models achieve:
- Nearly 100% language consistency across training languages
- Significant improvements in combined language consistency and accuracy (LC&Acc)
- Better performance than various baselines including prompt-based methods, supervised fine-tuning, and alternative RL approaches
- Strong generalization to out-of-domain languages, particularly within similar language families
- Notably, M-Thinker-7B even outperforms the larger DeepSeek-R1-0528 model on LC&Acc for several languages

The work demonstrates that it's possible to overcome the typical trade-off between language consistency and answer accuracy in multilingual reasoning, providing a practical solution for global deployment of reasoning models.

## Critique

Of course. Here is a critique of the paper "Think Natively: Unlocking Multilingual Reasoning with Consistency-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning," focusing on its strengths and weaknesses.

### Overall Impression

This is a strong, well-executed paper that tackles a clear and important problem in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs): their poor performance and language inconsistency in non-English contexts. The proposed method, M-Thinker, is effective, and the results are significant, particularly the achievement of near-perfect language consistency without sacrificing—and sometimes even improving—answer accuracy.

---

### Strengths

1.  **Clear Problem Formulation:** The paper immediately establishes its relevance by identifying two critical, well-documented limitations of current LRMs: (1) input-output language inconsistency and (2) inferior reasoning performance in non-English languages. The provided example (Figure 1) effectively illustrates the problem.

2.  **Novel and Well-Motivated Methodology:**
    *   **Strict Language Consistency (LC) Reward:** The move from "soft" language rewards (used in prior work) to a strict, binary reward (`-1` for any inconsistency) is a simple but powerful design choice that directly addresses the core problem.
    *   **Cross-lingual Thinking Alignment (CTA) Reward:** This is the most novel contribution. The idea of using the model's own high-quality English reasoning as a "teacher" to guide its reasoning in other languages via an LLM-as-a-judge is clever and resource-efficient. It leverages the model's inherent strengths rather than relying on external, potentially expensive, supervision.
    *   **Holistic Reward Design:** The combination of LC, CTA, Format, and Accuracy rewards into a single `R_all` function is logical and ensures the model is optimized for all desired behaviors simultaneously.

3.  **Comprehensive and Convincing Experimental Setup:**
    *   The use of two model sizes (1.5B and 7B) demonstrates the scalability of the approach.
    *   The careful split into In-Domain (ID) and Out-of-Domain (OOD) languages allows for a robust evaluation of both performance and generalization.
    *   The inclusion of a wide range of baselines, including prompt-based methods (Prompt-Control, DIT, QRT) and other RL variants (Naive-RL, SLC-RL), provides a thorough context for judging M-Thinker's performance.
    *   The primary metric, **LC&Acc**, is perfectly chosen as it directly measures the ultimate goal: providing a *correct answer* in the *correct language*.

4.  **Significant and Impressive Results:**
    *   The jump to **~99% Language Consistency** across ID languages is a monumental achievement and directly solves the first major problem identified.
    *   The results show that M-Thinker successfully breaks the trade-off between consistency and accuracy. On the 7B model, M-Thinker's LC&Acc not only far surpasses the base model but also **exceeds the Acc of the base model**. This means it's better to ask the model in your native language than in English.
    *   The strong performance on OOD languages demonstrates that the method teaches a generalizable "reason natively" skill rather than just overfitting to the training languages.

5.  **Thorough Analysis:** The ablation studies, investigation into different judge models for the CTA reward, and the generalization study provide valuable insights into *why* the method works and the importance of each component.

---

### Weaknesses

1.  **Computational Cost and Scalability:** The method is computationally intensive. It relies on:
    *   **Rejection Sampling:** Generating `N` candidates for every question in every RL iteration.
    *   **LLM-as-a-Judge:** Using a large model (DeepSeek-V3) to evaluate the CTA reward for every candidate during training.
    *   **Iterative RL:** Running this expensive process for multiple iterations.
    While the results justify the cost, the paper does not discuss the computational budget or the practicality of scaling this approach to dozens of languages or larger base models. The "Limitations" section acknowledges this but could be more explicit about the concrete costs.

2.  **Dependence on a Strong "Judge" Model:** The effectiveness of the key CTA reward is contingent on the quality of the LLM judge. The ablation in Section 5.2 shows that using a weaker judge (Qwen2.5-7B) actually harms performance compared to not using CTA at all. This creates a dependency that might be a bottleneck for wider adoption, especially for lower-resource organizations.

3.  **Limited Scope of Evaluation:**
    *   The evaluation is confined to **mathematical reasoning** (MMATH and PolyMath). While math is a good testbed for complex reasoning, it is not clear how well the method generalizes to other reasoning domains like commonsense reasoning, logical deduction, or scientific QA.
    *   The number of training languages (five) is relatively small. Testing on a more diverse set, including truly low-resource languages, would strengthen the claims about generalizability.

4.  **Clarity and Presentation:**
    *   The paper is generally well-written, but the description of the training procedure (Algorithm 1) is quite dense and could be difficult to follow for readers less familiar with advanced RL techniques. A higher-level summary in the main text could improve accessibility.
    *   The term "generalization" is used to describe performance on OOD languages, which includes English and Chinese. However, for these languages, the concern is more about **catastrophic forgetting** than generalization. This is noted in a footnote but using the term "forgetting" in the main text might be more precise.

### Conclusion

This paper presents a highly novel and effective solution to a critical problem in multilingual AI. The combination of a strict LC reward and the innovative CTA reward, trained through a rigorous iterative procedure, produces state-of-the-art results. The strengths of the paper—its clear problem definition, novel methodology, and compelling results—far outweigh its weaknesses, which are primarily related to computational cost and scope of evaluation. This work represents a significant step towards truly equitable and globally deployable reasoning models.

# Evolving and Executing Research Plans via Double-Loop Multi-Agent Collaboration

Authors: Zhi Zhang, Yan Liu, Zhejing Hu, Gong Chen, Sheng-hua Zhong, Jiannong Cao

Keywords: Multi-agent collaboration, Automated scientific research, Double-loop learning, Evolutionary algorithms, Bilevel optimization, Research planning and execution

## Abstract

Automating the end-to-end scientific research process poses a fundamental challenge: it requires both evolving high-level plans that are novel and sound, and executing these plans correctly amidst dynamic and uncertain conditions. To address this bilevel challenge, we propose a novel Double-Loop Multi-Agent (DLMA) framework to solve the given research problem automatically. The leader loop, composed of professor agents, is responsible for evolving research plans. It employs an evolutionary algorithm through involvement, improvement, and integration meetings to iteratively generate and refine a pool of research proposals, exploring the solution space effectively. The follower loop, composed of doctoral student agents, is responsible for executing the best-evolved plan. It dynamically adjusts the plan during implementation via pre-hoc and post-hoc meetings, ensuring each step (e.g., drafting, coding) is well-supported by contextual and external observations. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like ACLAward and Laboratory show that DLMA generates research papers that achieve state-of-the-art scores in automated evaluation, significantly outperforming strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm the critical roles of both loops, with evolution driving novelty and execution ensuring soundness.

## Summary

This paper introduces the **Double-Loop Multi-Agent (DLMA) Framework**, a novel approach to automate the end-to-end scientific research process. The framework is designed to address two fundamental challenges: evolving high-level research plans that are novel and technically sound ("doing the right things"), and correctly executing these plans amidst dynamic and uncertain conditions ("doing things right").

The core methodological innovation is the decomposition into two collaborative loops:
- **Leader Loop**: Composed of "professor" agents, this loop employs an evolutionary algorithm to iteratively generate and refine a population of research proposals. It uses three types of meetings (involvement, improvement, and integration) to explore the solution space, with a review panel selecting top proposals based on quality ratings.
- **Follower Loop**: Composed of "doctoral student" agents, this loop executes the best-evolved plan through dynamic adaptation. It uses pre-hoc meetings (revising plans based on contextual and external observations before actions) and post-hoc meetings (updating subsequent steps after actions) to ensure alignment between the plan and execution.

Experimental results on benchmarks including ACLAward and Laboratory demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. The DLMA framework significantly outperformed strong baselines including GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4, and other multi-agent systems like CycleResearcher and Agent Laboratory. Ablation studies revealed that the leader loop primarily contributes to novelty and excitement in research outputs, while the follower loop ensures technical soundness and execution quality. The framework achieved particularly strong results on soundness metrics, indicating its effectiveness in finding reasonable solutions to complex research problems.

The main limitations include significant computational costs (approximately 1,558 seconds and 1.75 million tokens per run) and occasional code hallucination issues where implementations diverge from descriptions. Overall, the DLMA framework represents a significant advancement in automated scientific research by explicitly addressing both plan evolution and reliable execution through structured multi-agent collaboration.

## Critique

Of course. Here is a critique of the paper "Evolving and Executing Research Plans via Double-Loop Multi-Agent Collaboration," focusing on its strengths, weaknesses, and overall contribution.

### Strengths

1.  **Novel and Well-Motivated Conceptual Framework:** The paper's core strength is its compelling conceptual framing. Drawing inspiration from "double-loop learning" and "bilevel optimization" provides a strong theoretical foundation that clearly differentiates it from prior work. The analogy of a "leader loop" (professors evolving plans) and a "follower loop" (doctoral students executing and adapting plans) is intuitive and effectively communicates the paper's central innovation.

2.  **Addressing a Critical Challenge:** The paper correctly identifies and tackles the two fundamental challenges in automated research: generating a novel and sound plan ("doing the right things") and then reliably executing it amidst uncertainty ("doing things right"). By decomposing the problem this way, the proposed DLMA framework addresses a more comprehensive set of difficulties than systems focused solely on plan generation or rigid plan execution.

3.  **Comprehensive and Rigorous Evaluation:** The evaluation is a significant strength. The use of multiple benchmarks (ACLAward, Laboratory, Plagiarism) with different characteristics provides a robust test bed. The ablation studies are particularly insightful, clearly demonstrating the distinct contributions of the evolution and adaptation modules to different aspects of paper quality (e.g., evolution drives "Excitement," adaptation ensures "Soundness"). The inclusion of case studies and analyses of the planning process (e.g., support rate in the follower loop) adds valuable qualitative depth.

4.  **Strong Empirical Results:** The results are impressive. Achieving state-of-the-art performance against strong baselines, including other multi-agent systems, on established benchmarks like ACLAward and Laboratory convincingly demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The meta-evaluation showing correlation with human judgment adds credibility to the automated evaluation method.

### Weaknesses

1.  **High Computational Cost:** The paper is transparent about a major weakness: the significant computational overhead of the DLMA framework. The reported cost of ~1,500 seconds and ~1.75 million tokens per run is substantial. While perhaps acceptable for a research demonstration, this limits the practical accessibility and scalability of the method. This cost is a direct trade-off for the performance gains and is a key area for future improvement.

2.  **Limited Exploration of the "Code Hallucination" Problem:** The paper briefly mentions that the code agent can "hallucinate," leading to a misalignment between the described method and its implementation. This is a critical failure mode for automated scientific research, as it undermines the validity of experimental results. The paper would be stronger if it included a deeper analysis of how often this occurs and its impact on the final paper's credibility, or proposed initial mitigations within the current framework.

3.  **Heavy Reliance on LLM-as-Judge:** While the use of LLM-as-a-judge is a common and practical choice, it remains a proxy for human evaluation. The reported Spearman correlation of 0.4609, while positive, indicates only a moderate alignment with human experts. A more extensive human evaluation, especially on the critical "Soundness" and "Originality" criteria, would further solidify the claims of the paper's superiority.

4.  **Clarity of the "Integration Meeting":** The methodology is generally well-explained, but the "integration meeting" operation in the leader loop could be described with more clarity. The process of generating two offspring, `δ(t_i, t_j)` and `δ(t_j, t_i)`, is somewhat abstract. A concrete, simplified example of how the strengths of two proposals are identified and combined would make this innovative component easier to understand and replicate.

### Overall Assessment

This is a high-quality and significant paper that makes a substantial contribution to the field of automated scientific research. Its main strength lies in its novel double-loop framework, which provides a principled and effective structure for tackling the dual challenges of plan generation and execution. The empirical results are strong and thoroughly validated through ablation studies and comparisons on multiple benchmarks.

The primary weaknesses are the high computational cost and the relatively superficial treatment of the code implementation reliability issue. However, the paper clearly identifies these as limitations and directions for future work.

**In summary,** the paper presents a conceptually novel, empirically validated, and comprehensively evaluated framework that represents a clear step forward in automating end-to-end scientific research. Its strengths in framing, methodology, and evaluation far outweigh its weaknesses, which are openly acknowledged.

## Abstract

The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the availability of high-quality post-training data, particularly instruction-tuning and preference-based examples. Existing open-source datasets, however, often lack multilingual coverage, cultural grounding, and suffer from task diversity gaps that are especially pronounced for Indian languages. We introduce a human-in-the-loop pipeline that combines translations with synthetic expansion to produce reliable and diverse Indic post-training data. Using this pipeline, we curate two datasets: Pragyaan-IT (22.5K) and Pragyaan-Align (100K) across 10 Indian languages covering 13 broad and 56 sub-categories, leveraging 57 diverse datasets. Our dataset protocol incorporates several often-overlooked dimensions and emphasize task diversity, multi-turn dialogue, instruction fidelity, safety alignment, and preservation of cultural nuance, providing a foundation for more inclusive and effective multilingual LLMs.

## Summary

Here is a summary of the paper "Pragyaan: Designing and Curating High-Quality Cultural Post-Training Datasets for Indian Languages":

**Key Contributions:** This work addresses the scarcity of high-quality, culturally-grounded post-training data for Indian languages by introducing the Pragyaan dataset series. The main contributions are: (1) a scalable human-in-the-loop pipeline for creating multilingual post-training data, (2) Pragyaan-IT (22.5K instruction-tuning examples) and Pragyaan-Align (100K preference examples) covering 10 Indian languages across 56 task categories, with emphasis on cultural context, task diversity, and safety alignment.

**Methods:** The authors developed a two-pronged approach combining translation with human refinement and synthetic expansion with human refinement. Starting from English prompts, they use LLM-based translation into Indian languages followed by manual editing for linguistic accuracy and cultural appropriateness. The pipeline incorporates multiple task settings including complexity levels, multi-turn interactions, instruction following constraints, safety considerations, thinking trails, and Indian cultural context (with three progressive grounding levels). The methodology leverages 57 diverse source datasets and employs human annotators for quality control throughout the process.

**Results:** Analysis shows the dataset covers 10 Indian languages with Gujarati, Kannada, Marathi and Odia having the highest representation. The data spans various task configurations with 62.3% easy tasks, 91.7% single-turn interactions, and strong Indian cultural grounding (57.8% IC-3 level). A pilot study using Direct Preference Optimization on Krutrim-2-12B and Llama-3-8B models demonstrated improved performance, with post-DPO versions winning or drawing in over 60% of cases compared to their pre-DPO counterparts when evaluated on the Updesh benchmark. The work provides a foundation for more inclusive and effective multilingual LLMs tailored to Indian cultural contexts.

## Critique

Here is a critique of the paper "Pragyaan: Designing and Curating High-Quality Cultural Post-Training Datasets for Indian Languages":

### **Strengths**

1.  **Clear Problem Definition and Motivation:** The paper effectively identifies a significant and timely problem: the scarcity of high-quality, culturally-grounded post-training data for multilingual LLMs, with a specific focus on the linguistically diverse context of India. The examples of cultural mismatch (e.g., suggesting "thyme" vs. "tulsi") are compelling and clearly illustrate the limitations of existing English-centric datasets.

2.  **Methodological Rigor and Novelty of the Pipeline:** The proposed two-pronged, human-in-the-loop (HITL) pipeline is a core strength. It thoughtfully combines the reliability of translating existing high-quality English data (Approach 1) with the diversity and scalability of synthetic expansion (Approach 2). The explicit definition of "Indian Cultural Context" levels (IC-1 to IC-3) is a nuanced and valuable contribution, moving beyond simple translation to active cultural adaptation. The focus on various task "settings" (complexity, multi-turn, instruction-following, safety) demonstrates a comprehensive approach to dataset design.

3.  **Significance and Scale of the Resource:** The creation and release of the Pragyaan datasets (22.5K instruction-tuning and 100K preference examples across 10 languages and 56 sub-categories) is a substantial and practical contribution. It addresses a critical resource gap and has the potential to significantly advance the development of LLMs for Indian languages.

4.  **Transparent and Comprehensive Analysis:** The paper provides a thorough analysis of the dataset's composition, including language and category distributions, task settings, and word counts. The pilot DPO experiment, while small-scale, provides initial, tangible evidence for the utility of the Pragyaan-Align dataset, showing improved win rates for models fine-tuned on it.

### **Weaknesses**

1.  **Limited and Preliminary Evaluation:** The most significant weakness is the evaluation. The downstream performance analysis (Section 5.3) is described as a "pilot study" and feels underdeveloped.
    *   The evaluation uses only 100 samples, which is a very small subset for a dataset of this scale.
    *   The use of an LLM-as-a-judge, while common, can be unreliable, and no inter-annotator agreement or validation of the judge's scoring is provided.
    *   The results are presented only as win/draw/loss rates without absolute performance scores (e.g., average score out of 5), making it difficult to gauge the magnitude of improvement.
    *   There is no comparison against baselines trained on other existing multilingual post-training datasets (e.g., translated Alpaca or xP3), which would have strengthened the claim of Pragyaan's superior quality.

2.  **Clarity Gaps in Methodology:** While the overall pipeline is well-explained, some specifics are unclear or relegated to the appendix.
    *   The exact LLM(s) used for generation and translation are not specified in the main text, which is a crucial detail for reproducibility.
    *   The process of how human annotators decided between "adapting the configuration" versus "creating a new pair" (Section 3.4) seems subjective, and more concrete guidelines or examples would be helpful.
    *   The "Self-Thinking" trail is mentioned but not well-defined or differentiated from Chain-of-Thought in a concrete way.

3.  **Imbalance in Dataset Composition:** The analysis in Table 2 and Figure 2 reveals a strong skew in the current dataset. The vast majority of instances are single-turn (91.66%), use simple instruction following (96.95%), and lack explicit thinking trails (>99%). While this reflects a pragmatic starting point, it somewhat undermines the paper's emphasis on "complexity" and "rich task settings." The authors acknowledge this as a target for future expansion.

### **Overall Assessment**

This paper presents a highly valuable and well-motivated contribution to the field of multilingual NLP. The proposed HITL curation pipeline is thoughtful and novel, and the resulting Pragyaan datasets fill an important resource gap. The main weakness lies in the evaluation, which, while promising, is not yet sufficient to fully substantiate the claimed high quality and effectiveness of the datasets. The paper would be significantly strengthened by a more rigorous and comprehensive evaluation, including comparisons to strong baselines and a larger, more statistically sound test set. Despite this, the methodological framework and the released resource itself represent a significant step forward for building more inclusive and culturally-aware language models.
