Today's research landscape showcases a significant pivot toward optimizing the collaborative and reasoning capabilities of language agents, with several papers introducing novel multi-agent frameworks. We see the emergence of "Agentic Reasoning Modules (ARM)" that evolve fundamental Chain-of-Thought (CoT) units through reflection-guided search, and systems like AgentFlow that perform in-the-flow optimization using a new "Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO)" algorithm. Concurrently, there's strong emphasis on architectural efficiency, highlighted by "Mixture of Neuron Experts (MoNE)", which improves parameter utilization in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models via neuron-level sparsity. In data-centric research, "Round-robin Synthetic data Evaluation (RoSE)" offers a clever proxy for selecting the best LLM generator without human test sets, while other work identifies a "valley of code reasoning" in distillation scaling and investigates the detrimental role of difficult prompts in "Self-play Preference Optimization". Finally, a rethinking of multilingual foundations is proposed through "Parallel Tokenizers", which align vocabularies across languages to enhance cross-lingual transfer.

## TL;DR

Based on the provided arXiv papers, here is a concise TL;DR summary capturing the main themes and insights:

**Core Theme: Advancing AI Systems through Multi-Agent Collaboration, Efficient Training, and Improved Reasoning**

The papers collectively explore methods to enhance AI capabilities, with a strong focus on making systems more efficient, robust, and generalizable. Key insights include:

1.  **Multi-Agent Systems & Collaboration:** Several papers propose frameworks where multiple AI agents collaborate or debate to solve complex tasks, leading to more robust and accurate outcomes than single-agent systems.
    *   **ARM** (https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05746v1) evolves fundamental "reasoning modules" that can be recursively used or orchestrated by a meta-policy, enabling powerful and generalizable multi-agent reasoning.

2.  **Efficient Training & Model Design:** A major theme is optimizing how models are trained and structured, particularly for resource-constrained scenarios.
    *   **Stratified GRPO** (https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06214v1) addresses structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM agents by grouping similar trajectories, eliminating bias and improving credit assignment.
    *   **Mixture of Neuron Experts (MoNE)** (https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05781v1) increases parameter efficiency in MoE models by activating only the most crucial neurons within an expert, matching performance while using 50% fewer parameters.
    *   **The Valley of Code Reasoning** (https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06101v1) identifies a non-monotonic scaling trend in knowledge distillation for code reasoning, where performance first drops then sharply rises with more data, and finds that output correctness in training data is surprisingly unimportant.

## Abstract

Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools such as search engines to solve complex, multi-step problems, and reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training them. However, the trajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations in the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally different answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient methods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and formalize as cross-stratum bias-an "apples-to-oranges" comparison of heterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment and hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address this, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage Normalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on their structural properties and computes advantages locally within each stratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true peers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields conditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains the global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard normalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To improve practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly blend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that Stratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3 points, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more effective search policies. These results establish stratification as a principled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents.

## Summary

Based on the paper "Stratified GRPO: Handling Structural Heterogeneity in Reinforcement Learning of LLM Search Agents," here is a summary of its key contributions, methods, and results.

**Key Contributions:**
The paper identifies and formalizes a fundamental problem in RL for LLM search agents called **cross-stratum bias**. This bias arises because search agent trajectories are structurally heterogeneous—they differ in the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls, leading to different reward distributions. Standard policy gradient methods, which use a single global baseline to compute advantages, unfairly compare these heterogeneous trajectories, distorting credit assignment and hindering the exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies.

**Methods:**
To address this, the authors propose **Stratified GRPO**, whose core component is **Stratified Advantage Normalization (SAN)**. Instead of using a global baseline, SAN partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on structural properties (e.g., the number of search calls) and computes advantages locally within each stratum. This ensures trajectories are only compared to their true peers, eliminating cross-stratum bias. Theoretically, SAN is proven to be conditionally unbiased and to have unit variance within each stratum, providing a pure and scale-stable learning signal. To enhance stability in finite-sample regimes, the method also introduces a **Blended Advantage**, which linearly combines SAN with the global estimator.

**Results:**
Extensive experiments on seven question-answering benchmarks (including single-hop and multi-hop tasks) demonstrate that Stratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms standard GRPO and other strong baselines. It achieves up to an **11.3-point improvement** in average performance over GRPO, with particularly pronounced gains on multi-hop QA tasks (up to 14.5 points). Additionally, Stratified GRPO exhibits higher training rewards, greater training stability (avoiding the collapse seen in GRPO with instruct models), and learns more effective search policies—converging to ~2.5 search calls per question compared to GRPO's ~1, indicating better exploration of multi-step strategies.

## Critique

Of course. Here is a critique of the paper "Stratified GRPO: Handling Structural Heterogeneity in Reinforcement Learning of LLM Search Agents."

### Overall Assessment

This is a strong, well-executed paper that identifies a genuine problem in a popular research area and provides a principled, theoretically-grounded, and empirically validated solution. The core idea is elegant and the results are compelling.

---

### Strengths

1.  **Novelty and Problem Identification:** The paper's greatest strength is identifying and formalizing the "cross-stratum bias." The intuition—that comparing trajectories with different numbers of search calls is an "apples-to-oranges" comparison—is clear and compelling. While stratification is a classic statistical technique, its application to RL for LLM agents to solve this specific structural heterogeneity problem is novel and insightful.

2.  **Theoretical Rigor:** The paper goes far beyond a simple heuristic. It provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis, including:
    *   A clear decomposition of the global advantage to expose the cross-stratum bias (Proposition 1).
    *   Proofs of variance reduction (Theorem 1) and invariance properties (Proposition 2).
    *   A rigorous comparison between Stratified Advantage Normalization (SAN) and Global Normalization (GN), proving that SAN provides a "pure, scale-stable" signal carrier within each stratum (Theorem 4), while GN is conditionally biased.

    This theoretical foundation significantly strengthens the methodological contribution.

3.  **Significant and Convincing Empirical Results:** The experimental evaluation is thorough and convincing.
    *   **Substantial Gains:** Improvements of up to 11.3 points over GRPO and 8.3 points over the best baseline are significant, especially in the context of QA benchmarks.
    *   **Diverse Benchmarks:** Using seven different datasets (both single-hop and multi-hop) demonstrates the generality of the approach.
    *   **Ablation Study:** The ablation (Table 2) cleanly shows the contribution of each component (SAN and the blending), validating the design choices.
    *   **Analysis of Training Dynamics:** The analysis of training rewards and search call behavior (Figure 1) provides crucial insights beyond final performance metrics. It shows that Stratified GRPO leads to more stable training (preventing collapse in the Instruct model) and successfully learns to use more search calls, which directly explains its superior performance on multi-hop tasks.

4.  **Clarity of Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written. The structure is logical, moving from problem identification to method, theory, and experiments. The use of propositions and theorems makes the theoretical arguments easy to follow. The decomposition of the GN advantage in Proposition 3 is particularly effective for building intuition.

---

### Weaknesses

1.  **Choice of Stratification Variable:** The paper uses the *number of search calls* as the partitioning function. While this is a natural and effective choice, it is somewhat simplistic. The "structure" of a trajectory could be more complex, involving the *type* of calls, their sequence, or the content of the queries. The paper does not discuss the potential or challenge of using more sophisticated stratification schemes, which could be a direction for future work.

2.  **Hyperparameter `α` for Blending:** The "Blended Advantage" is a practical solution to finite-sample instability in small strata. However, the paper does not specify how the blending coefficient `α` was set in the experiments. Was it tuned, or set to a fixed value? The performance and stability of the method could be sensitive to this choice, and a lack of discussion on how to set it is a minor weakness.

3.  **Comparison to an "Oracle" Baseline:** While the comparison to existing methods is strong, it would have been interesting to see a comparison to an "oracle" baseline that uses a perfectly trained, stratum-conditioned value function (e.g., in a PPO setup). This would more directly isolate the benefit of the stratification idea from the limitations of the GRPO framework itself. The authors' argument that the bias issue likely affects PPO is reasonable, but a direct empirical comparison would have been even stronger.

4.  **Computational Overhead:** The method introduces minimal computational overhead, which is a positive. However, a brief quantitative comment on the runtime or memory cost compared to standard GRPO would have been useful for completeness.

---

### Summary

**Strengths:** High novelty in problem formulation, exceptional theoretical depth, significant and well-demonstrated empirical results, and clear presentation.
**Weaknesses:** Minor limitations regarding the exploration of complex stratification, the tuning of the blending hyperparameter, and the lack of an "oracle" baseline comparison.

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of RL for LLM agents. The core idea of Stratified GRPO is simple, powerful, and backed by strong theory and experiments. It addresses a fundamental flaw in standard practice and is likely to influence future work in this area.

# RoSE: Round-robin Synthetic Data Evaluation for Selecting LLM Generators without Human Test Sets

Authors: Jan Cegin, Branislav Pecher, Ivan Srba, Jakub Simko

Keywords: synthetic data evaluation, LLM generator selection, proxy metrics, low-resource languages, round-robin evaluation

## Abstract

LLMs are powerful generators of synthetic data, which are used for training smaller, specific models. This is especially valuable for low-resource languages, where human-labelled data is scarce but LLMs can still produce high-quality text. However, LLMs differ in how useful their outputs are for training. Selecting the best LLM as a generator is challenging because extrinsic evaluation requires costly human annotations (which are often unavailable for low-resource languages), while intrinsic metrics correlate poorly with downstream performance. We introduce Round robin Synthetic data Evaluation (RoSE), a proxy metric for selecting the best LLM generator without human test sets. RoSE trains a small model on the outputs of a candidate generator (LLM) and then evaluates it on generated synthetic examples from all other candidate LLMs. The final RoSE score is the mean performance of this small model. Across six LLMs, eleven languages, and three tasks (sentiment, topic, intent), RoSE identifies the optimal generator more often than any other intrinsic heuristics. RoSE outperforms intrinsic heuristics and comes within 0.76 percentage points of the optimal generator baseline. This result is measured in terms of downstream performance, obtained by training a small model on the chosen generator's outputs (optimal vs. proxy metric selected) and evaluating it on human-labelled test data. Additionally, RoSE is the only metric to achieve a positive correlation with performance on human test data.

## Summary

Of course. Here is a summary of the paper "RoSE: Round-robin Synthetic Data Evaluation for Selecting LLM Generators without Human Test Sets".

### Summary

This paper introduces **RoSE (Round-robin Synthetic data Evaluation)**, a novel proxy metric for selecting the best Large Language Model (LLM) to generate synthetic training data in scenarios where human-annotated test sets are unavailable, which is a common challenge for low-resource languages.

**Key Problem:** While LLMs are powerful synthetic data generators, their utility for training smaller downstream models varies. Selecting the best generator typically requires costly human-labeled data for extrinsic evaluation. Intrinsic metrics (e.g., diversity, entropy) are cheap but have been shown to correlate poorly with downstream performance.

**Proposed Method (RoSE):** The core idea of RoSE is to use the synthetic data from different LLMs to cross-evaluate each other. For a set of candidate LLMs, the method works as follows:
1.  Each LLM generates a synthetic dataset for a given task and language.
2.  For each candidate LLM, a small model (e.g., XLM-R) is trained on its synthetic data.
3.  This small model is then evaluated on the synthetic test sets generated by *all the other* candidate LLMs.
4.  The **RoSE score** for a candidate LLM is the mean performance of its trained model across all these cross-evaluations. The LLM with the highest RoSE score is selected as the best generator.

**Key Results:** The authors conducted extensive experiments across 11 languages (including low-resource ones), 3 tasks (sentiment, topic, intent), and 6 LLMs. The results demonstrate that RoSE significantly outperforms a wide range of intrinsic metrics and heuristics (like simply choosing the largest model):
*   **Selection Accuracy:** RoSE identified the optimal generator (as determined by human test data) in **60.6%** of cases, far more than any other metric.
*   **Performance Gap:** Downstream models trained on data from the RoSE-selected generator were, on average, only **0.76% F1** points worse than models trained on data from the optimal generator.
*   **Correlation:** RoSE was the **only** metric to achieve a consistently positive and strong correlation with human-based downstream performance, whereas intrinsic metrics showed weak or even negative correlations.

The paper also shows that RoSE remains effective with fewer candidate LLMs and that its performance is tied to using a high-quality generation setup that includes a few human examples in the prompts.

In conclusion, **RoSE provides a reliable and practical method for selecting the most effective LLM for synthetic data generation without needing human test sets**, making it particularly valuable for low-resource language applications.

## Critique

Of course. Here is a balanced critique of the paper "RoSE: Round-robin Synthetic Data Evaluation for Selecting LLM Generators without Human Test Sets."

### **Overall Summary**

This paper presents a novel, practical, and well-evaluated method for a critical problem in modern NLP: selecting the best LLM for synthetic data generation when human-annotated test sets are unavailable. The approach is methodologically sound, the experimental setup is extensive, and the results are compelling and significant.

---

### **Strengths**

1.  **High Novelty and Clever Intuition:** The core idea of RoSE is both novel and intuitive. The "round-robin" concept—training a model on one LLM's data and testing it on the data of all others—is an elegant way to measure the generalizability and coverage of a generator's output. It effectively creates a proxy for a human test set by using the collective output of other LLMs as a surrogate evaluation landscape.

2.  **Significant and Practical Problem:** The paper tackles a very real and growing problem, especially for low-resource languages. As the field increasingly relies on synthetic data, having a reliable, automated way to choose the best generator is crucial. The work has immediate practical applications for researchers and practitioners.

3.  **Extensive and Rigorous Evaluation:**
    *   **Scale:** The evaluation across 6 LLMs, 11 languages (covering a spectrum of resource levels), and 3 distinct tasks is comprehensive and inspires confidence in the generalizability of the results.
    *   **Strong Baselines:** The paper compares against a wide array of sensible baselines, including diverse intrinsic metrics and simple heuristics (like model size), demonstrating that RoSE isn't just better than a strawman.
    *   **Thorough Analysis:** The authors go beyond the main result with valuable ablations:
        *   Task- and language-specific breakdowns.
        *   Varying the number of candidate LLMs.
        *   A cost-effectiveness analysis (testing RoSE with fewer evaluation LLMs).
        *   Analyzing the impact of in-context examples on RoSE's performance.

4.  **Compelling Results:** The results are not just statistically significant; they are practically significant. An average performance gap of only **0.76% F1** compared to the optimal (oracle) selection is a remarkably strong outcome. The fact that RoSE is the *only* metric with a consistently positive correlation to human evaluation performance underscores its unique value.

5.  **Clarity of Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. Figure 1 provides an excellent, clear visual explanation of the RoSE methodology. The tables and subsequent figures effectively summarize the complex, multi-dimensional results.

---

### **Weaknesses**

1.  **Computational Cost:** The paper openly acknowledges that RoSE is computationally expensive, as it requires training multiple downstream models for each candidate LLM. While the cost-effectiveness analysis is a strength, it remains a significant barrier. For a user with a large pool of candidate LLMs, the cost of running RoSE for all pairwise comparisons could be prohibitive, potentially limiting its use in some scenarios.

2.  **Dependence on In-Context Examples:** The ablation in Section 5 reveals a critical dependency: RoSE's effectiveness drops significantly in a zero-shot generation setting ("RoSE-Z"). This means the method still requires a small set of human-annotated examples (10 per label) to work well. While this is far less than a full test set, it means the method is not a *complete* replacement for human data, but rather a way to maximize utility from a very small seed set.

3.  **Limited Exploration of "Why":** While the paper excellently demonstrates *that* RoSE works, it provides less insight into *why* it works so well. A deeper analysis of what characteristics of the synthetic data lead to a high RoSE score (e.g., diversity, fidelity to the latent data distribution, lack of artifacts) would have been valuable. For instance, why does a model that generalizes well to other LLMs' synthetic data also generalize well to human data?

4.  **Scope of Tasks and Models:** While the scope is already broad, the evaluation is confined to text classification tasks. It is unclear how RoSE would perform on generation tasks (e.g., machine translation, summarization) or more complex reasoning tasks. Furthermore, the set of 6 LLMs, though diverse, is still a limited sample of the rapidly expanding model ecosystem.

### **Conclusion**

This is a strong paper that makes a meaningful contribution to the field. The RoSE method is novel, effectively solves a pressing problem, and is backed by extensive and convincing evidence. Its main weaknesses—computational cost and reliance on a few in-context examples—are openly discussed and represent fertile ground for future work rather than fatal flaws. The paper is likely to be influential and provides a valuable tool for anyone working with synthetic data, particularly in low-resource settings.

# Mixture of Neuron Experts

Authors: Runxi Cheng, Yuchen Guan, Yucheng Ding, Qingguo Hu, Yongxian Wei, Chun Yuan, Yelong Shen, Weizhu Chen, Yeyun Gong

Keywords: Mixture-of-Experts, Mixture of Neuron Experts, Sparse Activation, Parameter Efficiency, Load Balance Loss, Neural Network Sparsity, Inference Efficiency, Model Scaling

Comments: 18 page, 11 figures, 7 tables

Paper link: [http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05781v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05781v1)

## Abstract

In this work, we first explore whether the parameters activated by the MoE layer remain highly sparse at inference. We perform a sparsification study on several representative MoE models. For each expert, we rank parameters by the magnitude of their activations from the gate projection and progressively prune the activated subset. Pruning up to 60% of parameters within that subset causes only negligible task-performance degradation; substantial drops occur only after more than 90% are removed. We further decompose experts into neuron-granular MoE and visualize their activation values, finding that most neuron activations are near zero. This observation motivates us to select only high-activation neuron experts during pretraining. Based on this insight, we propose Mixture of Neuron Experts (MoNE). MoNE achieves neuron-granular expert selection by only applying a simple top-k selection within each expert, incurs negligible latency, and requires no additional routing parameters or inter-expert communication. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoNE matches traditional MoE performance while activating only 50% of the MoE-layer parameters, and it consistently outperforms traditional MoE when compared at equal numbers of activated parameters. These results suggest that MoNE is a practical approach to improving parameter utilization and inference efficiency in MoE-like models.

## Summary

Of course. Here is a summary of the paper "Mixture of Neuron Experts," focusing on its key contributions, methods, and results.

### Summary

This paper introduces **Mixture of Neuron Experts (MoNE)**, a novel architecture that improves the parameter efficiency of traditional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by operating at a finer, neuron-level granularity.

**Key Insight & Motivation:** The authors first demonstrate that parameters activated within a traditional MoE layer are still highly sparse. Even after an expert is selected, only a small subset of its neurons (those with high activation values) are critical for the computation. Pruning up to 60-90% of the parameters within an activated expert causes negligible performance loss, revealing significant redundancy.

**Method:** Building on this, MoNE decomposes each expert into "neuron experts." For every input token and each selected expert, MoNE does not use the entire expert. Instead, it performs a simple, low-overhead **top-K selection on the neuron activations** (the output of the gate projection) and only uses the weights corresponding to the top-activated neurons for computation. This effectively creates a neuron-level MoE without needing a larger router or incurring cross-expert communication costs. The authors also propose a **Neuron Granular Load Balance Loss (NG-LBL)** to ensure more uniform utilization of neurons within each expert.

**Key Results:**
1.  **Matching Performance with Fewer Parameters:** When configured to activate only **50% of the MoE-layer parameters**, MoNE matches the performance of a traditional MoE model that uses all parameters.
2.  **Superior Performance at Parity:** When compared to traditional MoE models with an **equal total number of activated parameters**, MoNE consistently outperforms them across multiple model scales (e.g., ~925M and ~2.8B total parameters) and benchmarks.
3.  **Practical Efficiency:** MoNE achieves these gains without introducing significant latency or memory overhead, as it requires no additional routing parameters and avoids inter-expert communication.

In conclusion, MoNE offers a practical and effective method to enhance the utilization of activated parameters in MoE models, pushing toward more efficient and scalable architectures.

## Critique

Of course. Here is a critique of the paper "Mixture of Neuron Experts," covering its strengths, weaknesses, and overall contribution.

### Overall Summary

This paper presents "Mixture of Neuron Experts" (MoNE), a novel and pragmatic modification to the standard Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. The core idea is to exploit sparsity not just at the expert level, but *within* each expert at the neuron level, thereby improving parameter utilization without the typical overhead of fine-grained routing. The results are significant, demonstrating that MoNE can match or outperform traditional MoE while activating fewer parameters, making it a compelling contribution to the field of efficient large language model scaling.

---

### Strengths

1.  **High Novelty and Insightful Motivation:** The paper's foundation is a simple yet powerful observation: even the parameters *activated* by a traditional MoE router are highly sparse. The initial sparsification study (Figure 1) and visualization of neuron activations (Figure 2) provide strong, empirical evidence for this claim. This observation directly motivates the proposed method, making the research question and its solution feel inevitable and well-justified.

2.  **Elegant and Practical Method:** MoNE is conceptually elegant and, crucially, highly practical. Its key strength is achieving neuron-level expert selection **without introducing a massive, separate router or complex inter-expert communication**. The method leverages the existing gate projection within each expert and applies a simple, local top-k operation. This design choice avoids the primary bottlenecks (router size, communication latency) that plague other fine-grained MoE approaches, making MoNE a low-overhead and easily implementable technique.

3.  **Strong and Comprehensive Empirical Results:** The experimental evaluation is thorough and convincing.
    *   The primary result—that MoNE with 50% of the MoE-layer parameters matches traditional MoE performance—validates the core premise of improved parameter utilization.
    *   The comparison at equal activated parameters (Table 2) is particularly compelling, as it shows MoNE consistently outperforming the baseline, effectively demonstrating "more bang for the buck."
    *   The paper includes valuable ablation studies on the neuron selection ratio (Table 3), the effect of the neuron-level load balancing loss (NG-LBL), and the choice of activation function (Table 4), providing practical guidance for future implementations.

4.  **Clear and Well-Structured Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written. The logical flow from problem identification (sparsity within experts) to solution (MoNE) to validation (experiments) is easy to follow. The mathematical derivation for decomposing an expert into neuron-level components (Eq. 12) is clear and solidifies the theoretical grounding of the approach.

---

### Weaknesses

1.  **Limited Scale of Experiments:** The largest model tested has 2.81B total parameters. While the results are promising, the true test for any MoE method is its behavior at the scale of modern frontier models (e.g., hundreds of billions of parameters). It remains to be seen if the benefits of MoNE scale linearly or if new challenges emerge with model size, different parallelism strategies, and more complex data distributions.

2.  **Unexplored Interaction with Expert Specialization:** The paper does not deeply investigate *how* or *why* MoNE works from the perspective of expert specialization. In traditional MoE, experts often learn to specialize in specific topics or linguistic features. Does forcing each expert to use only a subset of its neurons per token encourage more refined sub-specializations within an expert? Or does it potentially disrupt the learned specialization? An analysis of what the "top-k" neurons in an expert are responding to could provide fascinating insights.

3.  **Clarity on Computational Cost:** While Table 5 shows that the throughput and memory footprint are comparable to traditional MoE, the computational cost of the per-expert sorting operation (`argtopK` on `Abs(G_i)`) is hand-waved as "negligible." For a very large number of experts or very large `d_expert`, this could become a non-trivial overhead. A more detailed analysis or discussion of this cost, especially relative to the matrix multiplication operations, would strengthen the efficiency claims.

4.  **Minor Presentation Issues:**
    *   The term "activation value" for the output of the gate projection (`G`) is slightly ambiguous, as "activation" can also refer to the output of an activation function like SiLU. Using a more precise term like "gating weight" or "expert-internal router score" could improve clarity.
    *   The paper mentions "one shared expert" but does not elaborate on its role or how it is integrated into the MoNE framework. A brief explanation would be helpful.

---

### Conclusion

This is a strong paper that makes a valuable contribution to the field of efficient LLM architectures. The proposed MoNE method is **novel, insightful, and practical**, addressing a genuine limitation of traditional MoE models with a simple and effective solution. The empirical evidence is robust and clearly demonstrates improved parameter efficiency.

The main limitations relate to the scale of the validation and a somewhat surface-level analysis of the mechanistic reasons behind the performance gains. Nonetheless, the core idea is likely to influence future work on MoE architectures, and the paper presents a convincing case for MoNE as a superior alternative to traditional MoE for training computationally efficient large-scale models.

## Abstract

Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Multi-agent systems (MAS) have achieved state-of-the-art results on various complex reasoning tasks. Recent works have proposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for manual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving similar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require computationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task domain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled validation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting that the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further investigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design that pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic Reasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular reasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is discovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple CoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution traces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which can be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned meta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually designed MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods. Crucially, MASes built with ARM exhibit superb generalization, maintaining high performance across different foundation models and task domains without further optimization.

## Summary

Based on the provided paper, here is a summary of its key contributions, methods, and results:

**Key Contributions:**
This paper introduces the Agentic Reasoning Module (ARM), a novel framework that enhances the traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning paradigm by replacing simple textual reasoning steps with specialized, agentic modules. The core insight is that while complex Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have been a focus of recent research, simple CoT often remains competitive, suggesting that improving the fundamental reasoning unit is more impactful than designing elaborate agent orchestrations. ARM is designed as a general-purpose, code-based module that can be automatically discovered and then applied across various tasks and models without re-optimization, offering superior performance and generalization compared to existing MAS approaches.

**Methods:**
The ARM framework decomposes reasoning into two components: a Step-Generator Module (m∗), which executes a single reasoning step using an internal MAS, and a Meta-Policy (π∗), which defines the high-level strategy for orchestrating these steps. To discover these components efficiently, the authors employ a Reflection-Guided Evolutionary Search algorithm. This method starts from a baseline CoT module and iteratively evolves it through mutations proposed by a Reviewer Agent (comprising a Critic that analyzes execution traces and a Designer that proposes code modifications). A key innovation is the use of scaffolded objectives: the Step-Generator is evaluated by replacing blocks of steps within a reference CoT trace, enabling stable credit assignment, while the Meta-Policy is discovered using a cheap surrogate (mCoT) and then transferred zero-shot to work with the optimized ARM.

**Results:**
The proposed ARM framework was evaluated on complex reasoning benchmarks (AIME, HMMT, GPQA, LiveBench) using multiple foundation models (GPT-4.1-nano, GPT-4o, LLaMA-3.3-70B). The results demonstrate that ARM consistently outperforms both handcrafted reasoning baselines (CoT, CoT-SC, Self-Refine, LLM-Debate) and state-of-the-art automated MAS design methods (ADAS, AFlow). Notably, ARM achieves these gains without domain-specific re-optimization, highlighting its robustness and generalizability. The combination of ARM with the discovered Meta-Policy (ARM + MP) yields the best performance, with significant improvements on challenging datasets like AIME and HMMT, underscoring the effectiveness of evolving fundamental reasoning units over constructing complex, heterogeneous agent systems.

## Critique

Of course. Here is a detailed critique of the paper "ARM: Discovering Agentic Reasoning Modules for Generalizable Multi-Agent Systems."

### Summary of Strengths

1.  **Strong Conceptual Novelty:** The paper's core idea is highly compelling and addresses a critical, observed problem in the field: the surprising competitiveness of simple Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting against complex, manually engineered Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). Instead of adding more layers of complexity, the authors pivot to improving the fundamental "reasoning unit" itself. The concept of an "Agentic Reasoning Module" (ARM) as an evolved, agentic replacement for a single CoT step is a fresh and insightful direction.

2.  **Well-Designed Methodology:** The proposed methodology is elegant and well-justified.
    *   **Decomposable Framework:** Separating the problem into a "Step-Generator" (the ARM) and a "Meta-Policy" is a clean abstraction that makes the problem more tractable.
    *   **Scaffolded Surrogate Objective:** The technique of evaluating a candidate ARM by splicing it into a stable baseline CoT trace is a clever solution to the credit assignment problem. It provides a stable and efficient way to measure the quality of an individual reasoning step.
    *   **Decoupled Discovery:** Discovering the Meta-Policy using the cheap `m_CoT` as a surrogate for the expensive `m*` is a pragmatic and effective strategy for computational efficiency, and the paper provides empirical validation for its validity.

3.  **Significant and Robust Results:** The empirical results are a major strength. The paper demonstrates that:
    *   **ARM outperforms strong baselines,** including both handcrafted methods (CoT-SC, Self-Refine) and automated MAS designers (ADAS, AFlow) across multiple benchmarks and model families (GPT-4.1-nano, GPT-4o, LLaMA-3.3-70B).
    *   **It validates the initial observation** that simple operators often beat complex MAS, making ARM's success over these operators even more noteworthy.
    *   It shows **impressive generalizability.** The same ARM and Meta-Policy, discovered once on a generic dataset, work well across different tasks and foundation models without re-optimization, a key advantage over task-specific automated MAS.

4.  **Rigorous Analysis:** The paper goes beyond just presenting results. The analyses in Section 7 are excellent. They empirically validate the core assumptions of the method:
    *   Showing that the search objective successfully finds modules with lower per-step error.
    *   Disentangling and confirming the sources of performance gain from the Meta-Policy transfer.

### Summary of Weaknesses

1.  **Clarity and Presentation of the Core Concept:** While the high-level idea is clear, the initial description of what an ARM *is* could be more concrete. The description of it being a "code-based multi agentic system" or a "self-contained MAS" is somewhat abstract. The appendices (C and D) help by showing the actual discovered code, but a more accessible, simplified example in the main text (perhaps a pseudo-code snippet or a more detailed breakdown of Figure 1) would significantly improve clarity for a broader audience.

2.  **Computational Cost of Discovery:** The paper is upfront about the cost of automated MAS methods like ADAS and AFlow, but it does not provide a detailed comparison of the computational cost of its own evolutionary search process. How many LLM calls (for the Reviewer Agent) and evaluations does the ARM discovery require? A discussion of the search efficiency and a rough comparison of the total cost versus the baselines would provide a more complete picture of the method's practicality.

3.  **Limited Analysis of Discovered Strategies:** The paper shows that ARM works, but could do more to explain *how* and *why*. A deeper qualitative analysis of the top-performing ARM (CriticChainOfThoughtV7) and Meta-Policy would be highly valuable. What specific behaviors or strategies did the evolutionary process discover? For instance, what kind of "criticism" is the module performing? How does the meta-policy decide to branch or refine? This would offer deeper insights into what makes a good reasoning step.

4.  **The "Homogeneous vs. Heterogeneous" Claim:** The paper positions ARM as building a powerful MAS from "homogeneous building blocks," contrasting with the "heterogeneous" nature of traditional MAS. This is a slight oversimplification. While the same ARM code is used repeatedly, the *state* it operates on (the problem and reasoning history) changes, and the internal "agents" within the ARM could be considered to have emergent, context-dependent specializations. This point could be nuanced further.

### Overall Assessment

This is a strong paper with a novel and impactful contribution. It successfully identifies a key limitation in current MAS research and proposes a principled, effective, and generalizable solution. The methodology is sound, the experiments are thorough and convincing, and the analyses provide strong support for the proposed approach. The main weaknesses are primarily in the realm of presentation and deeper analysis of the discovered components, rather than in the core contribution's validity or significance. The work has the potential to influence the field by shifting focus from designing complex agent orchestrations to evolving more powerful fundamental reasoning primitives.

# In-the-Flow Agentic System Optimization for Effective Planning and Tool Use

Authors: Zhuofeng Li, Haoxiang Zhang, Seungju Han, Sheng Liu, Jianwen Xie, Yu Zhang, Yejin Choi, James Zou, Pan Lu

## Abstract

Outcome-driven reinforcement learning has advanced reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but prevailing tool-augmented approaches train a single, monolithic policy that interleaves thoughts and tool calls under full context; this scales poorly with long horizons and diverse tools and generalizes weakly to new scenarios. Agentic systems offer a promising alternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain training-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics of multi-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow agentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier, generator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside the multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles long-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn optimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It broadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align local planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with group-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale backbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of 14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on scientific tasks, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT-4o. Further analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow optimization, showing improved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and positive scaling with model size and reasoning turns.

## Summary

Based on the provided paper, here is a summary of its key contributions, methods, and results:

**Key Contributions:**
1.  **AgentFlow:** A novel, trainable agentic framework that decomposes complex reasoning tasks across four specialized modules (Action Planner, Tool Executor, Execution Verifier, and Solution Generator) coordinated via a shared, evolving memory. Its key innovation is the ability to perform *in-the-flow* optimization, where the planner is trained directly within the live, multi-turn interaction loop of the system.
2.  **Flow-GRPO (Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization):** A new on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm designed to tackle the long-horizon, sparse-reward challenge in multi-turn agentic systems. Its core idea is to broadcast a single, verifiable final-outcome reward to every turn in a trajectory, effectively converting the complex multi-turn RL problem into a series of more tractable single-turn policy updates. It stabilizes learning using group-normalized advantages.

**Methods:**
The paper identifies limitations in existing paradigms: monolithic tool-integrated LLMs that scale poorly, and training-free agentic systems that cannot adapt. AgentFlow addresses this by creating a system where modules interact over multiple turns. The state is defined by the query, toolset, and evolving memory. The planner's policy is optimized using Flow-GRPO, which collects on-policy rollouts from the live system. A key design choice is using a single final-outcome reward (e.g., from an LLM-as-a-judge) for the entire trajectory, which is then normalized across a group of rollouts to calculate advantages for each action, aligning all local decisions with global success.

**Results:**
The system, built on a Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct backbone, was evaluated across ten diverse benchmarks covering search, agentic, mathematical, and scientific reasoning.
- AgentFlow significantly outperformed all specialized 7B-scale baselines, including tool-integrated reasoning models and the training-free agentic system AutoGen, with average accuracy gains of **14.9%** on search, **14.0%** on agentic, **14.5%** on math, and **4.1%** on scientific tasks.
- Remarkably, the 7B-based AgentFlow even surpassed the much larger proprietary model **GPT-4o (∼200B parameters)** across all evaluated domains.
- Ablation studies confirmed the necessity of *in-the-flow* RL optimization (Flow-GRPO), as offline supervised fine-tuning of the planner led to catastrophic performance collapse.
- Analyses showed that Flow-GRPO training led to more optimized tool usage, significantly reduced tool-calling errors (up to **28.4%**), and enabled the autonomous discovery of new, effective solution pathways. The benefits of the method were also shown to scale positively with both model size and the inference-time turn budget.

## Critique

Of course. Here is a detailed critique of the paper "In-the-Flow Agentic System Optimization for Effective Planning and Tool Use," covering its strengths, weaknesses, and overall contribution.

### Summary

This paper introduces **AgentFlow**, a trainable, multi-agent framework for tool-augmented reasoning, and **Flow-GRPO**, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm designed to train the system's planner "in-the-flow" of its multi-turn execution. The core innovation lies in bridging the gap between monolithic, tool-integrated LLMs and static, training-free agentic systems.

### Strengths

1.  **High Novelty and Ambitious Scope:** The paper addresses a significant and timely problem: how to effectively *train* a multi-agent system for complex, long-horizon reasoning tasks. The idea of performing on-policy RL directly within the live, multi-turn loop of an agentic system is a substantial departure from prior work, which largely relies on offline training or remains entirely training-free. The proposed "in-the-flow" optimization is a compelling conceptual contribution.

2.  **Well-Designed Technical Approach:**
    *   **AgentFlow Architecture:** The decomposition into four specialized modules (Planner, Executor, Verifier, Generator) coordinated by an evolving memory is a clean and logical design. It provides structure and transparency compared to monolithic reasoning chains.
    *   **Flow-GRPO Algorithm:** The central algorithmic insight—broadcasting a single, final-outcome reward to every turn in a trajectory—is elegant. It effectively reframes the intractable long-horizon credit assignment problem into a series of simpler, single-turn policy updates. The use of group-normalized advantages is a sensible technique for stabilizing training in this sparse-reward setting.

3.  **Extensive and Impressive Empirical Results:** The experimental section is a major strength. The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of ten benchmarks (search, agentic, math, science) using only a 7B parameter model. The fact that it outperforms much larger models like GPT-4o is a powerful testament to the efficacy of the approach. The results are not just a single high score but consistently strong across diverse domains.

4.  **Thorough Analysis and Ablations:** The paper goes beyond mere performance tables to provide valuable insights:
    *   The analysis of how tool usage shifts post-training (e.g., more Google Search for general knowledge, more Wikipedia for specialized domains) shows that the planner learns meaningful, task-specific strategies.
    *   The ablation study in Section 4.4 is particularly convincing, showing that offline SFT fails catastrophically while simply using a more powerful but frozen planner (GPT-4o) provides only modest gains. This strongly justifies the need for the proposed in-the-flow RL.
    *   The scaling analysis (model size, turn budget) demonstrates the robustness and generalizability of the method.

5.  **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written. Figures 1, 2, and 4 effectively illustrate the core problem, the AgentFlow architecture, and the Flow-GRPO algorithm. The formalization of the problem as a multi-turn MDP is clear.

### Weaknesses

1.  **Computational Cost and Complexity:** A significant practical weakness is the immense computational cost and engineering complexity of the proposed method. Training an on-policy RL algorithm that requires rolling out the *entire* multi-agent system for each update step is extremely expensive. The need for 8 A100 GPUs and the involvement of live tools (web search, code execution) makes the training process slow, costly, and potentially unreliable. This limits the reproducibility and accessibility of the work for most research labs.

2.  **Limited Analysis of Failure Modes and Limitations:** While the paper highlights successes, it provides less insight into when and why AgentFlow fails. For instance:
    *   How does the system handle cases where the verifier or executor modules are incorrect?
    *   Are there specific types of tasks (e.g., those requiring high-level creative planning) where the approach struggles?
    *   The memory module is presented as a solution to context growth, but its capacity and potential limitations are not discussed.

3.  **Justification of Design Choices:** Some design choices, while reasonable, are not deeply justified or ablated. For example:
    *   Why exactly four modules? Would a different decomposition (e.g., merging verifier and generator) work as well or better?
    *   The choice to train *only* the planner is a key simplification, but the paper does not fully explore the potential benefits or challenges of jointly fine-tuning other modules (e.g., the verifier).

4.  **Comparison to a Narrower Set of Baselines in Some Areas:** While the comparison to tool-integrated RL models is comprehensive, the comparison to other *trainable* agentic systems is less so. The primary agentic baseline is AutoGen, which is training-free. It would be stronger to compare against other recently proposed trainable multi-agent frameworks, if any exist, to better situate the contribution within its specific niche.

### Overall Assessment

This is a **high-quality, impactful paper** that makes a significant contribution to the field of reasoning LLMs and AI agents. The core idea of "in-the-flow" optimization for agentic systems is novel and powerful. The empirical results are exceptional and convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over existing paradigms.

The main weaknesses are practical (high computational cost) and relate to the depth of the failure mode analysis. However, these do not detract from the paper's core conceptual and empirical advances. It opens up a promising new research direction for creating more adaptive, efficient, and powerful collaborative AI systems. The work is likely to influence subsequent research in agentic systems and tool-use optimization.

# MADIAVE: Multi-Agent Debate for Implicit Attribute Value Extraction

Authors: Wei-Chieh Huang, Cornelia Caragea

Keywords: Multi-Agent Debate, Implicit Attribute Value Extraction, Multimodal Large Language Models, E-commerce, Zero-Shot Learning

Comments: None

Paper link: [http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05611v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05611v1)

## Abstract

Implicit Attribute Value Extraction (AVE) is essential for accurately representing products in e-commerce, as it infers lantent attributes from multimodal data. Despite advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), implicit AVE remains challenging due to the complexity of multidimensional data and gaps in vision-text understanding. In this work, we introduce \textsc{\modelname}, a multi-agent debate framework that employs multiple MLLM agents to iteratively refine inferences. Through a series of debate rounds, agents verify and update each other's responses, thereby improving inference performance and robustness. Experiments on the ImplicitAVE dataset demonstrate that even a few rounds of debate significantly boost accuracy, especially for attributes with initially low performance. We systematically evaluate various debate configurations, including identical or different MLLM agents, and analyze how debate rounds affect convergence dynamics. Our findings highlight the potential of multi-agent debate strategies to address the limitations of single-agent approaches and offer a scalable solution for implicit AVE in multimodal e-commerce.

## Summary

Based on the provided paper, here is a summary focusing on its key contributions, methods, and results:

**MADIAVE: Multi-Agent Debate for Implicit Attribute Value Extraction**

This paper introduces **MADIAVE**, a novel framework that leverages multi-agent debate among Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to tackle the challenging task of **Implicit Attribute Value Extraction (AVE)** in e-commerce. Unlike explicit AVE, where attributes are directly stated in text, implicit AVE requires inferring latent attributes (e.g., a product's shape or length) from a combination of visual cues and textual information, which is inherently more complex. The core idea is that by having multiple MLLM agents debate their inferences over several rounds, they can iteratively refine their answers, verify each other's reasoning, and converge on a more accurate and robust consensus.

**Key Contributions & Methods:**
The primary contribution is the **MADIAVE framework** itself, which is, to the authors' knowledge, the first to apply a multi-agent debate mechanism to the multimodal implicit AVE task. The method operates in a fully **zero-shot** setting, avoiding expensive fine-tuning. The process involves:
1.  **Initial Round:** Multiple MLLM agents independently analyze a product's image and text to make an initial inference and provide a justification.
2.  **Debate Rounds:** In subsequent rounds, each agent receives the original data plus the responses and reasoning from all other agents. They are then prompted to reconsider their own answer based on this collective intelligence.
The authors conducted a **comprehensive evaluation** across eight different debate scenarios, including debates between identical MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o vs. GPT-4o) and different MLLMs (e.g., Llama-3.2 vs. GPT-4o), to systematically analyze how various model configurations impact performance and convergence.

**Key Results:**
*   **Performance Boost:** The MADIAVE framework consistently **improves inference accuracy** compared to single-model inference and previous baselines across all tested MLLMs (GPT-4o, Llama-3.2, Phi-3.5, Qwen2.5-VL, Claude-3.5, GPT-o1). For instance, GPT-4o's overall accuracy increased from 85.68% to 87.91%.
*   **Optimal Debate Configuration:** The most significant performance gains occur after just **one or two rounds** of debate. Adding more rounds or more agents under a fixed compute budget leads to diminishing returns and can even cause confusion, degrading performance.
*   **Convergence Dynamics:** The debate process effectively leads to consensus. Weaker models (e.g., Phi-3.5) show the largest absolute accuracy gains from debate, often by adopting the reasoning of a stronger "teacher" agent. However, the stronger agent can sometimes be negatively influenced by the weaker agent's flawed reasoning.
*   **Advantage over Majority Vote:** When controlling for the total number of model calls, the debate strategy **outperforms a simple majority vote** of independent inferences, demonstrating that the iterative exchange of reasoning is more valuable than just aggregating independent guesses.
*   **Efficiency:** While debate increases latency, it offers a favorable accuracy-cost trade-off, especially for weaker models, which achieve substantial performance improvements per additional second of compute.

## Critique

Of course. Here is a detailed critique of the strengths and weaknesses of the paper "MADIAVE: Multi-Agent Debate for Implicit Attribute Value Extraction."

### Overall Assessment

This is a strong, well-executed paper that makes a clear contribution by applying a multi-agent debate framework to a challenging multimodal problem. The experimental design is thorough, and the results are significant and practically useful.

---

### Strengths

1.  **Clear Novelty and Contribution:** The paper successfully identifies a gap in the literature. While multi-agent debate has been explored in text-only domains, its application to a multimodal task (Implicit AVE) is novel and well-motivated. The claim of being the "first study" to investigate this for multimodal implicit AVE is credible and forms a solid foundation for the paper's contribution.

2.  **Comprehensive and Rigorous Evaluation:** The experimental setup is a major strength. The authors go beyond a simple demonstration by systematically exploring various configurations:
    *   **Same-model vs. Different-model debates:** This provides nuanced insights into how agent capabilities interact.
    *   **Ablation studies on rounds and agents:** The analysis with a fixed compute budget (Table 5) is particularly insightful, moving beyond just reporting best performance to offering practical guidance on the optimal debate "depth vs. breadth" trade-off.
    *   **Comparison to baselines:** Including previous SOTA models and a controlled majority-vote experiment (Table 4) effectively isolates the benefit of the *reasoning process* in debate from simply having more samples.

3.  **Significant and Actionable Results:** The results are not just statistically significant but also practically meaningful.
    *   The consistent improvement across all models, especially for initially low-performing attributes, demonstrates the robustness of the approach.
    *   The finding that **1-2 debate rounds are optimal** is a crucial and valuable takeaway for practitioners, as it balances performance gains with computational cost.
    *   The analysis of the "teacher-student" dynamic in cross-model debates (where weaker models improve but stronger models can be slightly harmed) is an honest and important finding.

4.  **Clarity of Presentation:**
    *   The paper is generally well-structured and easy to follow.
    *   Figures 2, 3, and 4 effectively illustrate the framework and results.
    *   The inclusion of prompt templates (Table 1) and detailed scenario configurations (Table 2) enhances reproducibility.
    *   The "Limitations" section is appropriately candid.

### Weaknesses

1.  **Novelty of the Core Mechanism:** While the *application* is novel, the core multi-agent debate mechanism itself is not a new invention. The paper builds directly upon prior work in text-based LLM debates (e.g., Du et al., 2023; Chan et al., 2023). The introduction could do more to precisely articulate how the multimodal nature of the task introduces new challenges that the debate framework is uniquely positioned to solve, beyond what was established in prior text-only debate papers.

2.  **Limited Analysis of "Why" Debate Works:** The paper excels at showing *that* debate improves performance and *how* agents converge, but the analysis of *why* it works for this specific task is somewhat surface-level. A deeper dive into the types of reasoning errors that debate corrects would be valuable. For instance:
    *   Does debate primarily help resolve visual ambiguities, textual ambiguities, or the fusion of the two?
    *   Are there characteristic failure modes of single agents that the debate process consistently identifies and rectifies? The debate scripts in the appendix are a good start, but a more systematic categorization of corrected errors would strengthen the paper.

3.  **Computational Cost and Latency Discussion:** While Section 5.5 addresses latency, the discussion feels slightly downplayed given the significant practical implications. A 2x-2.6x increase in latency is substantial for real-time e-commerce applications. The recommendation for "selective implementation" is good, but it remains a clear weakness of the method. A more concrete analysis of the total cost (in terms of API calls or GPU hours) for the entire dataset would provide a fuller picture of the trade-offs.

4.  **Clarity in Specific Sections:**
    *   **Convergence Statistics (Section 5.2):** The description of Figure 4, while detailed, is somewhat dense and could be summarized more clearly. The terms "improved," "worsened," "corrected," and "deteriorated" are used frequently and can be confusing; a clearer definition upfront would help.
    *   **Baseline Comparison:** The justification for using a zero-shot setting to avoid bias is sound, but it would be fairer to acknowledge that this puts some trained baselines (like EIVEN) at an inherent disadvantage, as they were designed to leverage training data for higher performance.

### Summary

**MADIAVE** is a commendable piece of work that makes a tangible contribution to the field. Its primary strength lies in its thorough and practical experimental evaluation, which yields robust, significant results and clear, actionable insights for future research and application. The main weaknesses are a relatively incremental core mechanism and a need for a deeper analysis of the underlying reasons for the debate's success. Nonetheless, the paper effectively demonstrates that multi-agent debate is a powerful and promising strategy for tackling the complexities of multimodal inference.

# The Valley of Code Reasoning: Scaling Knowledge Distillation of Large Language Models

Authors: Muyu He, Muhammad Ali Shafique, Anand Kumar, Tsach Mackey, Nazneen Rajani

Keywords: knowledge distillation, code reasoning, scaling laws, training dynamics, supervised fine-tuning

## Abstract

Distilling the thinking traces of a Large Language Model (LLM) with reasoning capabilities into a smaller model has been proven effective. Yet, there is a scarcity of work done on how model performances scale with the quantity of distillation data. In this work, we study the scaling trend of distilling competitive coding skills on two small non-reasoning LLMs. We validate the hypothesis that there is a $\textit{valley of code reasoning}$: downstream performance on competitive coding first drops as data quantity increases, then it steadily increases in a sharper-than-log-linear fashion. Having identified the trend, we further fine-tune the models at two different distillation stages on the same data to ground conclusions on their respective learning phases. We learn that across stages in the low and medium-low data regimes, small models benefit significantly from easier coding questions than from harder ones. We also find that, surprisingly, the correctness of outputs in training data makes no difference to distillation outcomes. Our work represents a step forward in understanding the training dynamics of code reasoning distillation outside intuition

## Summary

This paper "The Valley of Code Reasoning: Scaling Knowledge Distillation of Large Language Models" investigates the training dynamics of distilling code reasoning capabilities from large language models into smaller models. The key contributions focus on understanding how data quantity and quality affect the distillation process for competitive coding tasks.

The authors identify a phenomenon they call the "valley of code reasoning" - a non-monotonic scaling trend where model performance initially drops when trained on small amounts of data (1K examples), then steadily improves in a sharper-than-log-linear fashion as data scales to 30K examples. They conduct experiments on two small instruction-tuned models (Qwen2.5-7B and Llama3.1-8B) using datasets derived from OpenCodeReasoning2 and TACO, evaluating on the LiveCodeBench benchmark.

Key findings reveal that: (1) Code correctness in training data makes no significant difference to distillation outcomes at any stage, confirming that output structure rather than correctness drives improvements; (2) Easier coding questions consistently outperform harder ones for small models in low-to-medium data regimes, with easy questions providing 33-41% improvements versus only 7-11% for hard questions; (3) Auxiliary metrics like completion rates and <think> tag occurrence rates show strong correlation with data quantity but weak correlation with final performance.

The work provides practical insights for efficient reasoning distillation, suggesting that prioritizing easier examples and focusing on reasoning structure rather than correctness can optimize training efficiency for small models in constrained data regimes.

## Critique

Of course. Here is a critique of the paper "The Valley of Code Reasoning: Scaling Knowledge Distillation of Large Language Models."

### Strengths

1.  **Clear and Important Research Focus:** The paper tackles a highly practical and under-explored problem in the era of large-scale model distillation: understanding the *training dynamics* of how reasoning capabilities are transferred, rather than just the final performance. The focus on scaling laws for distillation data quantity is timely and significant for efficient model development.

2.  **Compelling and Well-Supported Core Finding:** The central concept of a "valley of reasoning"—where performance initially drops before rising—is a strong, counter-intuitive, and empirically well-demonstrated finding. The consistent observation of this trend across two different model families (Qwen and Llama) adds significant weight to the claim. The sharper-than-log-linear improvement after the valley is a valuable insight for practitioners.

3.  **Rigorous and Multi-Faceted Experimental Design:** The paper is structured around three clear research questions (RQs), and the experimental setup is carefully designed to answer each one directly. Creating controlled subsets for data quantity, correctness, and difficulty allows for clean, interpretable comparisons. The use of auxiliary metrics like completion rate and `<think>` tag occurrence provides a deeper look into *how* the models are learning, beyond just the final benchmark score.

4.  **Actionable Practical Insights:** The results offer concrete guidance for practitioners:
    *   **RQ2:** The finding that output correctness in the distillation data has "no difference" is a powerful and surprising result that can simplify and reduce the cost of data curation.
    *   **RQ3:** The strong preference for "easier" examples in the low-to-medium data regime provides a clear strategy for prioritizing data when resources are limited.

### Weaknesses

1.  **Limited Scope and Scale:** The most significant limitation is the relatively small scale of the experiments. The "medium-low data regime" is defined as up to 30K samples, which, while relevant for some scenarios, is far below the millions of examples used in state-of-the-art distillation efforts (as mentioned in the related work). The conclusion that the trend is "highly predictable" is based on only three data points (1K, 10K, 30K). Extrapolating the trend to much larger scales is a key unanswered question, which the authors acknowledge in the conclusion.

2.  **Speculative Explanations:** The paper excels at identifying *what* is happening but is less definitive on *why*. For instance, the initial performance drop in the "valley" is noted but not thoroughly investigated or explained. Is it catastrophic forgetting of base capabilities? An initial struggle to learn the new reasoning structure? The weak correlation of the auxiliary metrics with performance in the RQ2/RQ3 experiments also raises questions about what the models are actually learning from easier vs. harder problems that isn't captured by structure imitation.

3.  **Novelty of Individual Findings:** While the overall study is novel, some of the constituent findings have been observed in prior work. The paper correctly cites Li et al. (2025) and others for the finding that correctness may not matter. The contribution here is validating this finding specifically across different *stages* of the distillation process, which is a nuanced but important extension.

4.  **Clarity and Presentation:**
    *   **Figures and Tables:** The critique is based on the text, but the description of Figure 1 and Table 2 is clear. However, the paper would benefit greatly from including the actual figures and tables for the reader to inspect directly.
    *   **Reproducibility:** While the training setup is described, key details like the specific random seeds used for sampling datasets are not mentioned, which could affect the reproducibility of the exact "valley" shape.

### Overall Assessment

This is a strong, focused research paper that makes a valuable contribution by meticulously mapping out the early-stage scaling behavior of reasoning distillation.

## Abstract

Self-play preference optimization has emerged as a prominent paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). It typically involves a language model to generate on-policy responses for prompts and a reward model (RM) to guide the selection of chosen and rejected responses, which can be further trained with direct preference optimization (DPO). However, the role of prompts remains underexplored, despite being a core component in this pipeline. In this work, we investigate how prompts of varying difficulty influence self-play preference optimization. We first use the mean reward of $N$ sampled responses of a prompt as a proxy for its difficulty. We find that difficult prompts exhibit substantially inferior self-play optimization performance in comparison to easy prompts for language models. Moreover, incorporating difficult prompts into training fails to enhance overall performance and, in fact, leads to slight degradation compared to training on easy prompts alone. We also observe that the performance gap between difficult and easy prompts closes as the model capacity increases, suggesting that difficulty interacts with the model capacity. Building on these findings, we explore strategies to mitigate the negative effect of difficult prompts on final performance. We demonstrate that selectively removing an appropriate portion of challenging prompts enhances overall self-play performance, while also reporting failed attempts and lessons learned.

## Summary

Based on the provided paper, here is a summary of its key contributions, methods, and results:

**Key Contributions:**
This paper investigates the critical but often overlooked role of prompt difficulty in self-play preference optimization for aligning large language models (LLMs). The authors make three main contributions: 1) introducing mean sample reward as a practical proxy for quantifying prompt difficulty, 2) demonstrating that difficult prompts substantially underperform easier ones in self-play optimization and can even degrade overall performance, and 3) exploring mitigation strategies, showing that selectively removing the most difficult prompts is an effective solution.

**Methods:**
The authors propose using the mean reward of N sampled responses (with N=10 found sufficient) as a difficulty measure for prompts. They conduct systematic experiments using models like Llama-3.1-Tulu-3-8B and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 with the UltraFeedback dataset and Skywork reward model. The study partitions prompts by difficulty quartiles and compares self-play preference optimization performance using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) across different difficulty subsets. They evaluate on benchmarks including AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, and explore various mitigation strategies including curriculum learning, improving chosen responses, and prompt pruning.

**Key Results:**
The research reveals several important findings: 1) The hardest quartile of prompts consistently underperforms easier prompts in self-play optimization, with significant performance gaps in both length-controlled and vanilla win rates. 2) Incorporating difficult prompts into training provides no performance benefit and slightly degrades results compared to using easier prompts alone. 3) Model capacity matters - stronger models like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct can nearly close the performance gap between hard and easy prompts. 4) Among mitigation strategies, selectively removing the most difficult prompts (30-50% depending on model) proved most effective, improving performance while reducing computational costs, whereas curriculum learning and improving chosen responses showed no benefits.

The paper concludes that prompt difficulty significantly impacts self-play preference optimization effectiveness and advocates for more careful consideration of prompt selection in alignment pipelines.

## Critique

Here is a critique of the paper "On the Role of Difficult Prompts in Self-Play Preference Optimization," focusing on its strengths, weaknesses, novelty, significance, and clarity.

### **Strengths**

1. **Novelty and Focus:**
   - The paper addresses an underexplored yet crucial aspect of self-play preference optimization: the role of prompt difficulty. While prior work has focused on reward models or preference pair construction, this study shifts attention to the *prompts themselves*, offering a fresh perspective.
   - The idea of using the mean reward of multiple sampled responses as a proxy for prompt difficulty is intuitive and practical. The authors validate this metric through stability analysis (e.g., showing that 10 samples suffice) and cross-model transferability.

2. **Significant Findings:**
   - The results demonstrate that difficult prompts (low mean reward) not only underperform easier ones but can slightly degrade overall performance when included in training. This challenges the naive assumption that more data (including hard prompts) is always better.
   - The observation that model capacity can mitigate the performance gap between hard and easy prompts adds depth to the analysis and underscores the importance of aligning prompt difficulty with model capability.

3. **Practical Insights:**
   - The proposed solution—pruning the most difficult prompts—is simple, effective, and computationally efficient. The results show consistent improvements on benchmarks like AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, even with reduced training data.
   - The authors transparently document unsuccessful attempts (e.g., curriculum learning, improving chosen responses), which adds credibility and provides valuable lessons for future work.

4. **Clarity and Structure:**
   - The paper is well-structured, with clear motivations, methods, and takeaways. The use of tables and figures (e.g., mean reward distributions, performance trends) effectively supports the narrative.
   - The writing is concise, and the contributions are explicitly outlined, making it easy to follow.

---

### **Weaknesses**

1. **Limited Scope of Prompts and Tasks:**
   - The experiments rely exclusively on UltraFeedback for prompts and AlpacaEval 2/Arena-Hard for evaluation. While these are reputable benchmarks, the findings may not generalize to other domains (e.g., specialized or low-resource tasks).
   - The definition of "difficulty" is tied to reward models, which themselves may exhibit biases or limitations. The paper does not explore alternative metrics (e.g., semantic complexity, task diversity) for assessing prompt difficulty.

2. **Lack of Theoretical Grounding:**
   - The study is empirical and lacks a theoretical explanation for *why* difficult prompts hinder optimization. For example, are difficult prompts inherently noisy, or do they lie outside the model's current capability boundary? A deeper analysis could strengthen the claims.

3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:**
   - The pruning threshold \( k \) (e.g., 30% for Tulu, 50% for Mistral) appears to be tuned heuristically. While the authors show trends for varying \( k \), the choice of optimal \( k \) may depend on the dataset and model, limiting the generalizability of the method.

4. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - The reliance on win rates and length-controlled metrics, while standard, may not fully capture nuanced aspects of model alignment (e.g., safety, coherence, or factual accuracy). Broader evaluation could strengthen the results.

---

### **Overall Assessment**

This paper makes a meaningful contribution by highlighting the overlooked role of prompt difficulty in self-play preference optimization. The approach is novel, the results are significant for improving alignment efficiency, and the presentation is clear and logical. While the study is empirically solid, it would benefit from broader experimentation and theoretical insights to fully establish its conclusions. The proposed pruning strategy is a practical takeaway that could influence how researchers and practitioners design alignment pipelines.

## Abstract

Tokenization defines the foundation of multilingual language models by determining how words are represented and shared across languages. However, existing methods often fail to support effective cross-lingual transfer because semantically equivalent words are assigned distinct embeddings. For example, "I eat rice" in English and "Ina cin shinkafa" in Hausa are typically mapped to different vocabulary indices, preventing shared representations and limiting cross-lingual generalization. We introduce parallel tokenizers. This new framework trains tokenizers monolingually and then aligns their vocabularies exhaustively using bilingual dictionaries or word-to-word translation, ensuring consistent indices for semantically equivalent words. This alignment enforces a shared semantic space across languages while naturally improving fertility balance. To assess their effectiveness, we pretrain a transformer encoder from scratch on thirteen low-resource languages and evaluate it on sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, emotion classification, and sentence embedding similarity. Across all tasks, models trained with parallel tokenizers outperform conventional multilingual baselines, confirming that rethinking tokenization is essential for advancing multilingual representation learning--especially in low-resource settings.

## Summary

Based on the provided paper, here is a summary focusing on its key contributions, methods, and results.

**Key Contribution:** This paper introduces **Parallel Tokenizers**, a novel framework designed to address fundamental limitations in multilingual language models. The core idea is to align tokenizer vocabularies across languages so that semantically equivalent words (e.g., "eat" in English and "ci" in Hausa) are mapped to the same vocabulary index, thereby enforcing a shared semantic space. This approach directly tackles two key problems in standard multilingual tokenization: fertility imbalance (where low-resource languages require more tokens to express the same meaning) and the separation of semantically equivalent words into different embeddings, which hinders cross-lingual transfer.

**Method:** The proposed method constructs parallel tokenizers in three main steps:
1.  **Base Tokenizer:** A monolingual tokenizer (using WordPiece) is first trained on English Wikipedia.
2.  **Vocabulary Alignment:** The "word-type" tokens from the English vocabulary are translated into target languages using machine translation (e.g., Google Translate). This creates a core set of aligned, semantically equivalent tokens across languages.
3.  **Vocabulary Expansion:** For each target language, a monolingual tokenizer is trained on its own Wikipedia corpus. The final vocabulary for each language is created by concatenating the aligned word-type tokens with the tokens from its monolingual tokenizer (with duplicates removed). During model input, a language identity embedding is added to help disambiguate unaligned tokens.

The authors pretrained transformer encoder models from scratch on 13 low-resource languages using this parallel tokenizer (Parallel-13L) and compared it against two strong baselines: the original mBERT tokenizer (Single-102L) and a tokenizer trained on the same 13 languages (Single-13L).

**Key Results:** The parallel tokenizer demonstrated consistent advantages across multiple evaluations:
*   **Tokenization Quality:** It achieved the best (lowest) fertility and parity scores, indicating more efficient and consistent tokenization across languages compared to the baselines.
*   **Downstream Task Performance:** On sequence classification tasks (sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, emotion classification), models using Parallel-13L generally outperformed the baselines across different data regimes (1%, 10%, 50%, 100% of training data).
*   **Cross-lingual Representation:** Analysis via PCA visualization and bitext mining showed that the parallel tokenizer led to more semantically aligned representations across languages, with sentences clustering by meaning rather than by language family. It achieved the lowest average error in bitext mining.
*   **Low-Resource Transfer:** In scenarios with limited or zero target-language training data, the parallel tokenizer facilitated stronger cross-lingual transfer than the baselines.

In conclusion, the paper presents a compelling case for rethinking vocabulary design in multilingual models. By explicitly aligning tokens across languages, the parallel tokenizer framework improves tokenization efficiency, enhances cross-lingual generalization, and boosts performance on various NLP tasks, particularly in low-resource settings.

## Critique

Of course. Here is a critique of the paper "Parallel Tokenizers: Rethinking Vocabulary Design for Cross-Lingual Transfer."

### Overall Summary

This is a strong, well-executed paper that tackles a foundational and often overlooked problem in multilingual NLP: the misalignment of tokenization across languages. The proposed "Parallel Tokenizer" is a simple yet powerful idea, and the paper provides compelling empirical evidence of its benefits, particularly for low-resource languages.

### Strengths

1.  **High Novelty and Conceptual Clarity:** The core idea—aligning token indices for semantically equivalent words across languages—is highly novel and addresses a clear, known weakness in multilingual models. The intuition is elegant: if "eat" in English and "ci" in Hausa share the same embedding index, cross-lingual transfer should be more direct and efficient. This is a significant rethink of standard vocabulary construction.

2.  **Comprehensive and Rigorous Evaluation:** The paper's experimental design is a major strength. It doesn't just show improvements on one task but demonstrates benefits across:
    *   **Tokenization Quality:** Using fertility and parity scores.
    *   **Downstream Performance:** Across four different classification tasks (sentiment, hate speech, emotion).
    *   **Representation Learning:** Using PCA visualization and bitext mining to show improved cross-lingual alignment.
    *   **Data Efficiency:** Testing performance with 1%, 10%, 50%, and 100% of training data.
    *   **Transfer Learning Scenarios:** Including zero-shot and continual pre-training settings.

3.  **Significant and Consistent Results:** The results are not just statistically significant; they are practically significant. The Parallel Tokenizer consistently outperforms strong baselines (Single-102L/mBERT and a custom-trained Single-13L) across almost all metrics and settings. The improvements in fertility, parity, and downstream F1 scores are clear and well-documented.

4.  **Focus on Low-Resource Languages:** The choice of languages, including several unseen by mBERT and those using non-Latin scripts (Amharic, Tigrinya), makes the work highly relevant and impactful. It directly addresses the issue of linguistic inequity in NLP.

5.  **Excellent Clarity and Presentation:** The paper is very well-written. The problem is motivated clearly, the method is explained step-by-step with helpful figures, and the results are presented in a logical, easy-to-follow manner. The use of appendices for detailed results is appropriate.

### Weaknesses and Limitations

1.  **Scalability and Practical Overhead:** The most significant weakness is the scalability of the approach. The process of creating a parallel tokenizer for a new set of `k` languages requires:
    *   Training `k` monolingual tokenizers.
    *   Performing word-by-word machine translation for the pivot language's vocabulary.
    *   Manually curating and concatenating the vocabularies.
    This is far more complex and computationally expensive than training a single multilingual tokenizer on a mixed corpus. The paper acknowledges this implicitly but could discuss it more directly as a limitation for very large-scale (100+ languages) models.

2.  **Translation as a Bottleneck and Source of Noise:** Relying on Google Translate for the core alignment step is a potential bottleneck and source of error. The paper notes issues with multi-word and malformed translations, which required back-translation filtering. The quality of the parallel tokenizer is inherently tied to the quality of this external MT system, which may be poor for truly low-resource pairs. The 61% alignment rate, while good, leaves 39% of tokens unaligned, which could be a source of interference.

3.  **Limited Task Scope:** While the evaluation across four classification tasks is comprehensive, the work is currently limited to encoder-only models and understanding tasks. It remains to be seen if the benefits hold for generative (decoder-only) models and for sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation or summarization.

4.  **Ablation Studies Could Be Deeper:** The paper convincingly shows that the *entire* parallel tokenizer pipeline works, but it doesn't fully disentangle which aspects are most critical. For instance, how much of the benefit comes from simply having better, monolingually-trained tokenizers for each language versus the specific cross-lingual index alignment? An ablation comparing a "Monolingual-13L" model (an ensemble of monolingual models) to the "Parallel-13L" model could be insightful.

5.  **Comparison to More Modern Baselines:** The primary baseline, mBERT (Single-102L), is a somewhat dated model. While the custom-trained Single-13L is a strong and fair baseline, comparing against a more modern multilingual encoder like XLM-Roberta in a continual pre-training setup could have strengthened the claims further.

### Conclusion

This is a high-quality paper that makes a valuable contribution to multilingual NLP. The proposed **Parallel Tokenizer** is a **novel and effective method** that directly addresses a key bottleneck in cross-lingual transfer. The **significance of the results** is high, demonstrated through rigorous and extensive experiments that show clear improvements in tokenization efficiency, downstream task performance, and semantic alignment.

The main weaknesses revolve around **scalability** and the **practical overhead** of the method, as well as a reliance on external MT systems. However, the paper honestly acknowledges these limitations. The clarity of the presentation is excellent, making the work accessible and easy to build upon.

In summary, this paper successfully argues that rethinking vocabulary design is a fruitful and necessary direction for advancing multilingual representation learning, especially for low-resource languages. It is likely to inspire follow-up work in the community.
