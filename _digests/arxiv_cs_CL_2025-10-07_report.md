Today's research highlights a strong focus on optimizing the fundamental building blocks of language models, with several papers proposing novel methods to enhance reasoning and cross-lingual capabilities. A key theme is improving how models process and structure information: one paper introduces **Parallel Tokenizers**, a framework that redesigns vocabulary construction to better align semantically equivalent words across languages, significantly boosting cross-lingual transfer in low-resource settings. Another work presents **CAM (Constructivist Agentic Memory)**, a memory framework inspired by cognitive theory that uses hierarchical and dynamic structures to help large language models (LLMs) better comprehend long documents. In the realm of automated reasoning, **ARM (Agentic Reasoning Modules)** offers a paradigm shift by evolving specialized, agentic modules to replace simple Chain-of-Thought (CoT) steps, leading to more generalizable multi-agent systems. Complementing these architectural advances, other papers tackle data efficiency—one uses **Influence Functions (IFs)** for principled data selection in reasoning tasks, while **RoSE (Round-robin Synthetic data Evaluation)** provides a robust, human-free method for selecting the best LLM as a synthetic data generator, proving particularly valuable for low-resource languages.

## TL;DR

Here's a TL;DR summary of the key themes and insights from these papers:

**Cross-lingual & Multilingual NLP**: "Parallel Tokenizers" introduces vocabulary alignment to improve cross-lingual transfer by ensuring semantically equivalent words share embeddings across languages, particularly benefiting low-resource settings.

**Data Efficiency & Selection**: "Influence Functions" uses causal impact analysis to select high-quality reasoning data, while "RoSE" provides a round-robin evaluation method for choosing optimal LLM data generators without human test sets.

**Agentic Reasoning & Memory Systems**: "ARM" evolves specialized reasoning modules from Chain-of-Thought, creating more effective multi-agent systems, and "CAM" applies constructivist theory to build hierarchical memory structures for long-text comprehension.

**Common Insights**: All papers focus on making LLM systems more efficient and robust—whether through better tokenization, smarter data selection, or more sophisticated reasoning architectures—with particular emphasis on generalization across tasks and resource-constrained scenarios.

# Parallel Tokenizers: Rethinking Vocabulary Design for Cross-Lingual Transfer

Authors: Muhammad Dehan Al Kautsar, Fajri Koto

Keywords: Parallel Tokenizers, Cross-Lingual Transfer, Vocabulary Design, Multilingual Language Models, Low-Resource Languages, Tokenization Efficiency, Semantic Alignment

Comments: 18 pages, 25 tables, 7 figures

## Abstract

Tokenization defines the foundation of multilingual language models by determining how words are represented and shared across languages. However, existing methods often fail to support effective cross-lingual transfer because semantically equivalent words are assigned distinct embeddings. For example, "I eat rice" in English and "Ina cin shinkafa" in Hausa are typically mapped to different vocabulary indices, preventing shared representations and limiting cross-lingual generalization. We introduce parallel tokenizers. This new framework trains tokenizers monolingually and then aligns their vocabularies exhaustively using bilingual dictionaries or word-to-word translation, ensuring consistent indices for semantically equivalent words. This alignment enforces a shared semantic space across languages while naturally improving fertility balance. To assess their effectiveness, we pretrain a transformer encoder from scratch on thirteen low-resource languages and evaluate it on sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, emotion classification, and sentence embedding similarity. Across all tasks, models trained with parallel tokenizers outperform conventional multilingual baselines, confirming that rethinking tokenization is essential for advancing multilingual representation learning--especially in low-resource settings.

## Summary

This paper introduces **Parallel Tokenizers**, a novel framework for multilingual language modeling that addresses fundamental limitations in cross-lingual transfer by redesigning vocabulary construction. The key insight is that conventional multilingual tokenizers, which use a single shared vocabulary across languages, often fail to align semantically equivalent words (e.g., "eat" in English and "ci" in Hausa), assigning them distinct embeddings and thus hindering effective cross-lingual generalization. This misalignment, combined with fertility imbalance (where low-resource languages require more tokens to express the same meaning), limits model performance, especially in low-resource settings.

The core contribution is a **method for constructing parallel tokenizers**: first, a monolingual tokenizer (English) is trained as a pivot; then, its word-type vocabulary is translated into target languages using machine translation; finally, these aligned word tokens are combined with tokens from monolingual tokenizers trained on each target language. This ensures that semantically equivalent words across languages share the same token indices and embedding representations. The model input incorporates **language identity embeddings** to disambiguate unaligned tokens and maintain language-specific signals.

The authors evaluated their approach by pretraining transformer encoders on 13 low-resource languages (both seen and unseen by mBERT) and benchmarking against standard multilingual tokenizers (Single-102L and Single-13L). Key results demonstrate that **Parallel Tokenizers**:
- Achieve **superior tokenization quality**, with lower fertility (more compact segmentation) and parity scores (better cross-lingual consistency) than multilingual baselines.
- **Outperform baselines** on sequence classification tasks (sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, emotion classification) across varying data availability levels (1% to 100% training data), showing stronger cross-lingual transfer.
- Yield **more semantically aligned representations**, as evidenced by improved bitext mining performance and PCA visualizations where sentences cluster by meaning rather than language family.

The work underscores that rethinking tokenization is crucial for advancing multilingual representation learning, particularly for low-resource languages, and provides a scalable framework for enhancing cross-lingual semantic sharing without retraining entire vocabularies.

## Critique

Of course. Here is a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the paper "Parallel Tokenizers: Rethinking Vocabulary Design for Cross-Lingual Transfer."

### Overall Summary

This is a well-executed and impactful paper that tackles a fundamental, often overlooked problem in multilingual NLP: the misalignment of tokenization across languages. The proposed "Parallel Tokenizer" is a simple yet powerful idea, and the authors provide comprehensive empirical evidence of its effectiveness, particularly for low-resource languages.

---

### Strengths

1.  **High Novelty and Conceptual Simplicity:** The core idea—aligning vocabularies across languages by translating the word-type tokens of a pivot (English) tokenizer—is highly novel. It directly addresses the semantic fragmentation issue where equivalent words in different languages get different embeddings. The approach is elegant and intuitive, making it easy to understand and build upon.

2.  **Rigorous and Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper's experimental design is a major strength. The authors go beyond a single task and benchmark their method across:
    *   **Tokenization Quality:** Using fertility and parity scores.
    *   **Downstream Performance:** Multiple sequence classification tasks (sentiment, hate speech, emotion).
    *   **Representation Analysis:** Bitext mining and PCA visualization to show improved cross-lingual alignment.
    This multi-faceted evaluation provides strong, holistic evidence for the method's benefits.

3.  **Significant and Consistent Results:** The results are not just statistically significant; they are practically meaningful. The Parallel Tokenizer consistently outperforms strong multilingual baselines (Single-13L and mBERT's Single-102L) across nearly all data regimes (from 1% to 100% of training data). The improvements in cross-lingual representation similarity (Table 3, Figure 4) are particularly convincing, demonstrating that the method achieves its primary goal of creating a more unified semantic space.

4.  **Strong Focus on Low-Resource Languages:** The choice of languages is excellent. By including languages both seen and *unseen* by mBERT, and focusing on those with limited resources, the paper highlights the method's value precisely where it is needed most. The analysis of performance with limited or zero target-language data (Section 5.4) is a crucial and well-placed experiment.

5.  **Clarity and Thoroughness:** The paper is generally well-written and clearly structured. The figures effectively illustrate the core concept and results. The inclusion of extensive appendices with detailed results, hyperparameters, and ablation studies (e.g., on input representation) adds to the paper's credibility and reproducibility.

---

### Weaknesses

1.  **Dependence on Machine Translation Quality:** The authors correctly identify this as a limitation. The method's foundation is the quality of the word-level translations from Google Translate. Errors in translation (e.g., incorrect sense, multi-word outputs) directly introduce noise into the aligned vocabulary. While their use of back-translation is a good mitigation, this remains a potential point of failure, especially for very low-resource or morphologically complex languages not well-handled by the MT system.

2.  **Scalability to a Large Number of Languages:** The paper demonstrates the method for 13 languages. A key question is how it scales to hundreds of languages. The process of creating a parallel tokenizer for each new language requires training a monolingual tokenizer and performing the alignment step. While more scalable than retraining a full model from scratch, it could become computationally and logistically complex compared to a single multilingual tokenizer, especially if the pivot language's vocabulary is not optimal for the new language family.

3.  **Limited Exploration of the Pivot Language Choice:** The paper uses English as the pivot, which is a natural choice but may not be optimal. The performance might differ if a different, perhaps more morphologically "average" language were chosen as the pivot. A brief discussion or ablation on this choice would have strengthened the method's generalizability.

4.  **Slightly Buried Lead in Continual Pre-training:** In Section 5.6, the continual pre-training results show that the Parallel Tokenizer does not always outperform the Single-13L baseline on downstream tasks, even though it still shows better cross-lingual alignment. This nuanced result is important but could be more prominently discussed in the conclusion, as it suggests that the benefits in representation space do not always directly translate to task performance when starting from a strong pre-trained base like mBERT.

### Conclusion

This is a strong paper that makes a valuable contribution to multilingual NLP. The proposed **Parallel Tokenizer** is a **novel and effective solution** to a well-known problem. Its **significance is high**, as it provides a clear path to more equitable and efficient models for low-resource languages. The **presentation is clear** and supported by extensive, well-designed experiments. The main weaknesses relate to its dependence on external MT resources and questions of extreme scalability, which the authors openly acknowledge and which provide clear directions for future work. This paper is likely to influence how researchers and practitioners think about and construct tokenizers for multilingual models.

# Influence Functions for Efficient Data Selection in Reasoning

Authors: Prateek Humane, Paolo Cudrano, Daniel Z. Kaplan, Matteo Matteucci, Supriyo Chakraborty, Irina Rish

Keywords: Influence Functions, Data Selection, Reasoning, Chain-of-Thought, Fine-tuning, Data Pruning, Math Reasoning

Comments: None

Paper link: [http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06108v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06108v1)

## Abstract

Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on chain-of-thought (CoT) data shows that a small amount of high-quality data can outperform massive datasets. Yet, what constitutes "quality" remains ill-defined. Existing reasoning methods rely on indirect heuristics such as problem difficulty or trace length, while instruction-tuning has explored a broader range of automated selection strategies, but rarely in the context of reasoning. We propose to define reasoning data quality using influence functions, which measure the causal effect of individual CoT examples on downstream accuracy, and introduce influence-based pruning, which consistently outperforms perplexity and embedding-based baselines on math reasoning within a model family.

## Summary

Of course. Here is a summary of the paper "Influence Functions for Efficient Data Selection in Reasoning."

**Key Contribution:** This paper proposes a novel method for selecting high-quality data to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. The core idea is to use **influence functions (IFs)** to define data quality based on the causal effect a training example has on downstream model accuracy, rather than relying on indirect heuristics like problem difficulty or diversity.

**Methodology:** The authors fine-tune a base model (LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct) on the LIMO reasoning dataset to get a converged model. They then analyze how fine-tuning changes the model's performance on a validation set (MATH500), identifying which validation questions transitioned from incorrect to correct (set C) and vice-versa (set I). For each training example, they compute its influence score, which estimates its contribution to these performance changes on the validation sets. This results in two scores per training example: `s_C(d)` (beneficial influence) and `s_I(d)` (harmful influence). They then test three pruning strategies:
1.  **Correct:** Prune examples with the least beneficial influence.
2.  **Incorrect:** Prune examples with the most harmful influence.
3.  **Combined:** A hybrid of the two.

**Key Results:**
1.  **Effective Within-Model Pruning:** When fine-tuning the same model family (LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct) used for data selection, the IF-based pruning strategies consistently matched or outperformed strong baselines like random selection, perplexity-based filtering (Mid-PPL), and embedding-based selection (RDS+). This demonstrates that IFs can successfully identify a higher-quality data subset for improving reasoning performance.
2.  **Limited Cross-Model Transfer:** When the data subsets selected using LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct were used to fine-tune a different model family (Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct), the benefits did not consistently transfer. This suggests that data quality, as measured by influence functions, may be somewhat model-specific.

In conclusion, the paper establishes influence functions as a powerful, principled tool for data selection in reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results within a model family, while highlighting model-specificity as a key area for future research.

## Critique

Of course. Here is a critique of the paper "Influence Functions for Efficient Data Selection in Reasoning," focusing on its strengths, weaknesses, and overall presentation.

### Strengths

1.  **Novel and Principled Approach:** The core idea of applying Influence Functions (IFs) to define and select "quality" data for reasoning tasks is highly novel and well-motivated. Moving beyond heuristics like problem difficulty or CoT length to a method that directly estimates the *causal impact* of a training example on downstream accuracy is a significant conceptual advance.
2.  **Strong Empirical Results (Within-Model):** The paper provides compelling evidence that IF-based pruning works. On the LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct model, their method consistently matches or outperforms strong baselines like RDS+ and Mid-PPL across several math reasoning benchmarks (GSM8k, OlympiadBench, AMC23), demonstrating the practical utility of their approach.
3.  **Rigorous Methodology:** The methodology is well-designed. The separation of validation data into sets where fine-tuning improved (`C`) or harmed (`I`) performance is clever, allowing for a nuanced definition of "beneficial" and "harmful" influence. The combination of raw influence scores with rank-based scores (`r(d)`) to mitigate outlier effects is a thoughtful and robust design choice.
4.  **Clarity of Presentation:** The paper is generally well-written and structured. The introduction effectively sets up the problem, the related work is clearly categorized, and the method section is detailed enough to be understood. Figures and tables are relevant and support the narrative.

### Weaknesses

1.  **Limited Cross-Model Generalizability:** The most significant weakness is the failure of the method to transfer convincingly across model families. The fact that data selected using LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct's IFs does not consistently help Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct raises a critical question: **is data quality model-specific?** This limitation curtails the broader applicability and significance of the findings, suggesting the approach may be most useful for in-family distillation rather than as a general data curation tool.
2.  **High Computational Cost:** The paper openly acknowledges but does not solve the high computational cost of calculating Influence Functions, which involves Hessian approximations. This is a major practical barrier to widespread adoption, especially as model sizes continue to grow. The lack of a cost-benefit analysis comparing the compute for selection vs. the savings from training on a smaller dataset is a minor omission.
3.  **Narrow Experimental Scope:** The evaluation, while positive, has limitations:
    *   **Single Dataset:** Experiments are conducted only on the LIMO dataset, which is pre-curated. The performance of IF-based pruning on a larger, noisier dataset (like Open-R1) remains an open and important question.
    *   **Limited Baselines:** The comparison lacks some relevant reasoning-specific heuristics mentioned in the related work (e.g., Select2Reason). A more comprehensive head-to-head comparison would strengthen the claim of superiority.
    *   **Single Run per Experiment:** The lack of multiple runs with different random seeds means the results are presented without confidence intervals, making it difficult to assess the statistical significance of the improvements.
4.  **Clarity Gaps in Pruning Strategy:** The description of the three pruning strategies, while illustrated, could be more precise. For instance, the exact intersection logic (e.g., percentiles used for "low" `s_C(d)` and `r_C(d)`) is not explicitly stated in the main text, requiring the reader to infer from the context and appendix.

### Overall Assessment

This is a **high-quality paper** that makes a valuable contribution by introducing a principled, causality-based framework for data selection in reasoning. The novelty of the approach and its strong within-model performance are its key strengths. However, the **lack of cross-model generalization** is a substantial limitation that tempers the broader impact of the results. The paper successfully proves the concept but also highlights a crucial challenge for future work. It is clearly presented, though the experimental scope could be broader and the computational cost remains a significant practical hurdle.

# RoSE: Round-robin Synthetic Data Evaluation for Selecting LLM Generators without Human Test Sets

Authors: Jan Cegin, Branislav Pecher, Ivan Srba, Jakub Simko

Keywords: Synthetic Data Evaluation, LLM Selection, Low-resource Languages, Proxy Metrics, Round-robin Evaluation

Comments: 16 pages

Paper link: [http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06143v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06143v1)

## Abstract

LLMs are powerful generators of synthetic data, which are used for training smaller, specific models. This is especially valuable for low-resource languages, where human-labelled data is scarce but LLMs can still produce high-quality text. However, LLMs differ in how useful their outputs are for training. Selecting the best LLM as a generator is challenging because extrinsic evaluation requires costly human annotations (which are often unavailable for low-resource languages), while intrinsic metrics correlate poorly with downstream performance. We introduce Round robin Synthetic data Evaluation (RoSE), a proxy metric for selecting the best LLM generator without human test sets. RoSE trains a small model on the outputs of a candidate generator (LLM) and then evaluates it on generated synthetic examples from all other candidate LLMs. The final RoSE score is the mean performance of this small model. Across six LLMs, eleven languages, and three tasks (sentiment, topic, intent), RoSE identifies the optimal generator more often than any other intrinsic heuristics. RoSE outperforms intrinsic heuristics and comes within 0.76 percentage points of the optimal generator baseline. This result is measured in terms of downstream performance, obtained by training a small model on the chosen generator's outputs (optimal vs. proxy metric selected) and evaluating it on human-labelled test data. Additionally, RoSE is the only metric to achieve a positive correlation with performance on human test data.

## Summary

This paper introduces **RoSE (Round-robin Synthetic data Evaluation)**, a novel proxy metric for selecting the best large language model (LLM) as a synthetic data generator when human-annotated test sets are unavailable—a common challenge in low-resource language settings. 

**Key Contribution:** RoSE addresses the critical limitation of existing intrinsic metrics (e.g., diversity scores, token entropy), which often correlate poorly with downstream task performance. It provides a practical, human-test-free method to reliably identify the optimal LLM generator for training smaller, task-specific models.

**Method:** RoSE operates through a round-robin evaluation process:
1. Each candidate LLM generates synthetic training and test data for a given task-language pair.
2. A small downstream model (e.g., XLM-R) is trained on one LLM’s synthetic data and evaluated on the synthetic test sets from all other LLMs.
3. The RoSE score for an LLM is the mean performance of its trained model across these cross-evaluations. The LLM with the highest score is selected as the best generator.

**Results:** Extensive experiments across 11 languages and 3 tasks (sentiment analysis, topic classification, intent recognition) using 6 diverse LLMs demonstrate RoSE’s superiority:
- **Accuracy:** RoSE identified the optimal generator in **60.6%** of cases, significantly outperforming the next-best metric (36.36%).
- **Performance Gap:** Models trained on RoSE-selected data were within **0.76% F1** of those using the optimal generator (human-selected), compared to **2.52%** for the second-best metric.
- **Consistency:** RoSE achieved the **only positive correlation** with human-based performance and ranked best in 9 of 11 languages.
- **Robustness:** It remained effective with as few as three candidate LLMs and performed well even when excluding the largest model (unlike parameter-size heuristics).

**Ablation Insights:** RoSE’s effectiveness depends on using human examples in prompts during data generation; its zero-shot variant (RoSE-Z) performed notably worse, highlighting the importance of high-quality, human-like synthetic data for reliable evaluation.

In summary, RoSE offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for synthetic data generator selection in low-resource scenarios, bridging the gap between intrinsic metrics and extrinsic human evaluation.

## Critique

Of course. Here is a critique of the paper "RoSE: Round-robin Synthetic Data Evaluation for Selecting LLM Generators without Human Test Sets," focusing on its strengths, weaknesses, novelty, significance, and clarity.

### Strengths

1.  **High Novelty and Clever Intuition:** The core idea of RoSE is highly novel and well-motivated. The intuition that a good generator should produce data that allows a model to generalize to the outputs of *other* LLMs is elegant and directly addresses the problem of not having a human "oracle" test set. The round-robin cross-evaluation scheme is a direct and logical implementation of this idea.

2.  **Extensive and Rigorous Evaluation:** The paper's experimental design is a major strength. The evaluation across **6 LLMs, 11 languages** (spanning high to low-resource), and **3 distinct tasks** provides compelling, multi-faceted evidence for RoSE's effectiveness. This breadth makes the results highly generalizable.

3.  **Significant and Practical Results:** The results are not just statistically significant but also practically so. An average performance gap of only **0.76% F1** compared to the optimal (human-selected) generator is a remarkably strong result. The fact that RoSE is the **only metric with a consistently positive correlation** with human test performance underscores its unique utility.

4.  **Thorough Ablation Studies:** The paper goes beyond the main result with valuable ablations. Investigating the impact of excluding the largest model, varying the number of candidate LLMs, reducing computational cost, and testing a zero-shot variant (RoSE-Z) provides a deep understanding of the method's robustness and limitations.

5.  **Clear Superiority Over Baselines:** The paper convincingly demonstrates that RoSE is not just slightly better but substantially outperforms a wide range of common-sense and intrinsic baselines, including the strong but naive "largest model" heuristic.

### Weaknesses

1.  **High Computational Cost:** The authors openly acknowledge that RoSE is computationally expensive, as it requires training multiple downstream models for each candidate LLM. While the cost-effectiveness analysis (using fewer LLMs for evaluation) is a good addition, it remains a significant barrier for resource-constrained environments, potentially limiting its immediate widespread adoption.

2.  **Dependence on High-Quality Generation Setup:** The analysis in Section 5 reveals a critical limitation: RoSE's performance is heavily dependent on the quality of the initial data generation. When human in-context examples are removed (RoSE-Z), its effectiveness drops significantly. This means RoSE is not a silver bullet for scenarios with *absolutely zero* human data; it still requires a small seed of human examples to guide the generation process effectively.

3.  **Limited Scope of Tasks and Models:** While the scope is already broad, it is necessarily limited. The evaluation is confined to **text classification tasks**. It is unclear how RoSE would perform on generation tasks (e.g., machine translation, summarization) or more complex reasoning tasks. Similarly, only 6 open-weight LLMs were tested.

4.  **Potential Data Contamination:** The authors note the unknown impact of data contamination (where LLMs may have been trained on the test data) as a limitation. This is a common issue in LLM research but could potentially inflate the performance of some models and confound RoSE's rankings.

### Novelty

The novelty is **high**. The concept of using a round-robin evaluation on synthetic data itself as a proxy for human evaluation is, to the best of this reviewer's knowledge, a new and creative contribution. It reframes the problem from "evaluating data quality" to "evaluating the generalizability of a model trained on that data," which is a more direct measure of utility for the end goal.

### Significance

The significance of this work is **substantial**. For researchers and practitioners working with low-resource languages and domains, the lack of high-quality evaluation data is a fundamental roadblock. RoSE provides a principled, empirically-validated methodology for making a critical decision—which LLM to use as a data generator—without needing a costly human-annotated test set. This can accelerate research and application development in underserved linguistic and topical areas.

### Clarity of Presentation

The paper is **very clearly written and well-structured**.

*   **Writing:** The prose is clear, concise, and logically flows from the introduction to the conclusion.
*   **Visualizations:** Figure 1 provides an excellent, intuitive overview of the RoSE method. The bar plots and forest plots in the results section effectively communicate the key findings.
*   **Organization:** The separation of results by task, language, and various ablation studies makes the paper easy to follow. The tables succinctly summarize complex comparative data.
*   **Limitations:** The limitations section is honest and comprehensive, addressing the main caveats of the work.

### Overall Summary

This is a strong paper that introduces a novel, effective, and practically significant method for a pressing problem in NLP. Its major strengths are its clever core idea and its exhaustive evaluation. Its primary weaknesses are its computational cost and its reliance on a non-zero-shot generation setup, but these are openly discussed. The presentation is exemplary. This work is likely to be influential and widely cited in the field of data-efficient NLP and LLM application.

# CAM: A Constructivist View of Agentic Memory for LLM-Based Reading Comprehension

Authors: Rui Li, Zeyu Zhang, Xiaohe Bo, Zihang Tian, Xu Chen, Quanyu Dai, Zhenhua Dong, Ruiming Tang

Keywords: Agentic Memory, Constructivist Theory, Large Language Models, Reading Comprehension, Hierarchical Memory Structures, Memory Retrieval, Long-Text Processing

Comments: Accepted by NeurIPS 2025

Paper link: [http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05520v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05520v1)

## Abstract

Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are confronted with overwhelming information volume when comprehending long-form documents. This challenge raises the imperative of a cohesive memory module, which can elevate vanilla LLMs into autonomous reading agents. Despite the emergence of some heuristic approaches, a systematic design principle remains absent. To fill this void, we draw inspiration from Jean Piaget's Constructivist Theory, illuminating three traits of the agentic memory -- structured schemata, flexible assimilation, and dynamic accommodation. This blueprint forges a clear path toward a more robust and efficient memory system for LLM-based reading comprehension. To this end, we develop CAM, a prototype implementation of Constructivist Agentic Memory that simultaneously embodies the structurality, flexibility, and dynamicity. At its core, CAM is endowed with an incremental overlapping clustering algorithm for structured memory development, supporting both coherent hierarchical summarization and online batch integration. During inference, CAM adaptively explores the memory structure to activate query-relevant information for contextual response, akin to the human associative process. Compared to existing approaches, our design demonstrates dual advantages in both performance and efficiency across diverse long-text reading comprehension tasks, including question answering, query-based summarization, and claim verification.

## Summary

Based on the provided paper, here is a summary focusing on its key contributions, methods, and results:

**Key Contributions:** This paper introduces CAM (Constructivist Agentic Memory), a novel memory framework designed to enhance the long-text reading comprehension capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The primary contribution is a design blueprint for agentic memory, which is grounded in Jean Piaget’s Constructivist Theory from cognitive science. This blueprint posits that an effective memory module must embody three key traits: *structured schemata* (hierarchical organization of information), *flexible assimilation* (integrating new information into multiple existing structures), and *dynamic accommodation* (efficiently updating the memory structure with new inputs). CAM is presented as a prototype implementation that is the first to simultaneously incorporate all three traits.

**Methods:** The CAM framework constructs a hierarchical memory structure from input text chunks. Its core technical innovation is an *incremental overlapping clustering algorithm* for memory development. This process involves: 1) **Foundational Network Expansion**, where new text chunks are integrated into a semantic network based on textual relevance and narrative coherence; 2) **Ego-Centric Disentanglement**, which uses node replication to explicitly model a chunk's multiple roles, enabling flexible assimilation; and 3) **Online Clustering Updates**, which employs an incremental label propagation algorithm to dynamically update cluster assignments locally, ensuring efficient accommodation. For memory retrieval, CAM uses a "*Prune-and-Grow*" associative strategy that first globally locates query-relevant cues and then recursively explores the memory structure to gather supporting information.

**Results:** The authors evaluate CAM on several long-text reading comprehension benchmarks, including question answering (NovelQA, MultiHop-RAG), query-based summarization (QMSum, ODSum), and claim verification (FABLES). The results demonstrate that CAM consistently outperforms a range of strong baselines (including MemGPT, ReadAgent, RAPTOR, GraphRAG, and MemTree) across all datasets and metrics (e.g., ROUGE, LLM-as-a-judge accuracy, F1 score). A key advantage is its efficiency in online settings; CAM can integrate new text in batches and is over 4x faster than offline methods like RAPTOR, while maintaining stable performance. Ablation studies confirm the importance of its hierarchical structure and flexible assimilation. The paper concludes that adhering to the constructivist design principle leads to a memory system with superior performance and efficiency for LLM-based reading agents.

## Critique

### Overall Assessment
This paper presents CAM (Constructivist Agentic Memory), a novel framework for enhancing LLMs' long-text reading comprehension by drawing inspiration from Jean Piaget's Constructivist Theory. The paper is well-structured, methodologically sound, and demonstrates significant empirical improvements over existing approaches. Below, I outline its strengths and weaknesses.

---

### Strengths

1. **Novelty and Theoretical Foundation**:
   - **Novelty**: The paper introduces a principled approach to agentic memory design, grounded in cognitive science (Piaget's Constructivist Theory). This contrasts with heuristic-based methods in prior work and provides a clear blueprint for memory traits: *structured schemata*, *flexible assimilation*, and *dynamic accommodation*.
   - **Theoretical Rigor**: The integration of constructivist principles (e.g., assimilation/accommodation) into a technical framework is innovative and elevates the discussion beyond ad-hoc engineering solutions.

2. **Technical Contributions**:
   - **Prototype Implementation**: CAM’s incremental overlapping clustering algorithm and "Prune-and-Grow" retrieval strategy are technically sophisticated and directly embody the proposed design principles.
   - **Efficiency and Dynamicity**: The framework supports batch-level online updates, a significant advantage over offline or sequential-update baselines. The empirical results show a **4× speedup** in processing time while maintaining performance stability.

3. **Empirical Evaluation**:
   - **Comprehensive Benchmarks**: The paper evaluates CAM on six diverse datasets spanning single- and multi-document tasks (e.g., QA, summarization, claim verification), demonstrating broad applicability.
   - **Superior Performance**: CAM consistently outperforms strong baselines (e.g., RAPTOR, GraphRAG, MemTree) across all metrics, with an average gain of **3.0%** over the best competitors.
   - **Ablation Studies**: Ablations validate the importance of hierarchy and flexibility, and analyses of retrieval strategies, embeddings, and LLM backbones provide practical insights.

4. **Clarity and Presentation**:
   - The paper is well-organized, with clear motivations, method descriptions, and visualizations (e.g., Figure 2). The limitations and future directions are thoughtfully discussed, adding depth to the work.

---

### Weaknesses

1. **Scalability and Practical Deployment**:
   - **Computational Overhead**: While CAM is more efficient than offline baselines, its reliance on LLMs for summarization and clustering may still pose scalability challenges for real-time applications. The paper acknowledges this but does not propose lightweight alternatives.
   - **Hallucination Risks**: The use of LLMs for hierarchical summarization introduces potential error propagation, which is noted but not empirically addressed.

2. **Generalization Beyond Reading Comprehension**:
   - The focus on reading comprehension tasks limits the demonstrated scope of CAM. While the constructivist principle is general, its applicability to other domains (e.g., planning, multimodal reasoning) remains speculative.

3. **Evaluation Gaps**:
   - **Robustness to Noise/Inconsistencies**: The experiments assume internally consistent source texts. Real-world scenarios often involve contradictory information, which CAM does not explicitly handle.
   - **Human Evaluation**: While LLM-based judges (e.g., GPT-4o) are used, human evaluations would strengthen the validity of results, especially for subjective tasks like summarization.

4. **Theoretical-Practical Alignment**:
   - While the constructivist analogy is compelling, the mapping between cognitive processes (e.g., assimilation) and technical mechanisms (e.g., overlapping clustering) could be further justified with cognitive plausibility arguments.

### Significance and Impact
- **Significance**: CAM advances the field of agentic memory by providing a theoretically grounded, efficient, and high-performing framework. Its batch-level online capability addresses a critical gap in real-world long-text processing.
- **Impact**: The work could influence future research on cognitive-inspired AI architectures and encourage interdisciplinary collaborations between cognitive science and NLP. The open-sourced code facilitates adoption and extension.

## Abstract

Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Multi-agent systems (MAS) have achieved state-of-the-art results on various complex reasoning tasks. Recent works have proposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for manual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving similar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require computationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task domain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled validation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting that the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further investigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design that pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic Reasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular reasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is discovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple CoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution traces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which can be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned meta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually designed MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods. Crucially, MASes built with ARM exhibit superb generalization, maintaining high performance across different foundation models and task domains without further optimization.

## Summary

Based on the paper "ARM: Discovering Agentic Reasoning Modules for Generalizable Multi-Agent Systems," here is a summary of its key contributions, methods, and results:

**Key Contributions:**
The paper introduces Agentic Reasoning Modules (ARM), a novel framework that enhances traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning by replacing simple textual reasoning steps with specialized, agentic modules. ARM addresses the limitations of complex Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), which often underperform simple CoT baselines despite their architectural sophistication. The key contributions include: (1) proposing ARM as a generalizable, evolved version of CoT that significantly outperforms existing MAS approaches; (2) demonstrating ARM's robustness across diverse tasks and foundation models without task-specific re-optimization; and (3) providing a rigorous methodology for discovering optimal reasoning modules and meta-policies through evolutionary search.

**Methods:**
The ARM framework decomposes reasoning into two components: a *Step-Generator Module* (m∗), which executes granular reasoning steps using a self-contained MAS, and a *Meta-Policy* (π∗), which orchestrates these steps into a complete solution. To efficiently discover these components, the authors employ a Reflection-Guided Evolutionary Search algorithm. This method starts with a baseline CoT module and iteratively refines it through mutations informed by execution traces and reflection from a "Reviewer Agent" (comprising a Critic and Designer). A scaffolded surrogate objective is used to evaluate candidate modules within stable CoT contexts, enabling efficient credit assignment. The meta-policy is discovered separately using a cheap surrogate (mCoT) and transfers zero-shot to the optimized ARM module.

**Results:**
Experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks (AIME, HMMT, GPQA, LiveBench) across multiple foundation models (GPT-4.1-nano, GPT-4o, LLaMA-3.3-70B) show that ARM consistently outperforms both handcrafted MAS (e.g., Self-Refine, LLM-Debate) and automated MAS design methods (e.g., ADAS, AFlow). For instance, ARM + Meta-Policy achieved an average performance of 47.8% on GPT-4.1-nano, surpassing CoT-SC (41.8%) and other baselines. ARM also demonstrated strong generalization, maintaining high performance across domains and models without re-optimization. Analyses confirmed that ARM reduces per-step error rates and successfully transfers meta-policies from simple surrogates to powerful ARM modules.

## Critique

Of course. Here is a critique of the paper "ARM: Discovering Agentic Reasoning Modules for Generalizable Multi-Agent Systems," focusing on its strengths and weaknesses.

### Strengths

1.  **Novel and Well-Motivated Core Idea:** The paper's central thesis is powerful and timely. Instead of adding complexity by designing ever-larger and more intricate multi-agent systems (MAS), it proposes to "look under the hood" and improve the fundamental unit of reasoning itself—the individual step in a Chain-of-Thought (CoT). The observation that simple CoT often outperforms complex MAS is a compelling starting point, and the proposed solution—evolving a single, powerful, agentic reasoning module (ARM) to replace a simple LLM call—is both novel and elegant.

2.  **Strong and Comprehensive Empirical Results:** The paper provides extensive evidence for its claims. The results across multiple benchmarks (AIME, HMMT, GPQA, LiveBench) and multiple foundational models (GPT-4.1-nano, GPT-4o, LLaMA-3.3-70B) are convincing. The fact that ARM consistently outperforms both handcrafted baselines (CoT, Self-Refine) and state-of-the-art automated MAS systems (ADAS, AFlow) is a significant result that validates the proposed approach.

3.  **Emphasis on Generalizability and Efficiency:** A key weakness of many automated MAS methods is their need for expensive, task-specific re-discovery. ARM directly addresses this by being trained on a generic dataset and then applied zero-shot across diverse tasks and models. This makes the approach far more practical and scalable. The decoupled training strategy (finding the meta-policy using a cheap CoT surrogate) is a clever and efficient design choice, which is empirically validated in the analysis section.

4.  **Rigorous Methodology and Analysis:** The paper is methodologically sound. The "scaffolded surrogate objective" for evolving the step-generator is a well-justified solution to the credit assignment problem. The reflection-guided evolutionary search provides a structured and explainable way to explore the program space. The analysis section (Sections 7.1 and 7.2) effectively deconstructs the sources of ARM's performance gains, providing strong empirical validation for the theoretical motivations.

### Weaknesses

1.  **Clarity and Accessibility of the Core Abstraction:** While the core idea is brilliant, its presentation could be more intuitive. The jump from a CoT "step" (a line of text) to an ARM "step" (a full, code-based multi-agent system) is conceptually large. The paper could benefit from a more gradual build-up or a more detailed, concrete example early on (perhaps in the introduction or methodology overview) to help the reader form a clear mental model of what an ARM "step" actually looks like in practice before delving into the formalisms.

2.  **Limited Insight into the Discovered Modules:** The paper convincingly shows *that* ARM works, but offers less insight into *what* the evolved modules actually do. Appendices C and D list the best-found modules, but their names (e.g., `CriticChainOfThoughtV7`) are opaque. A deeper qualitative analysis of one or two key mutations—what specific weakness the reviewer agent identified and what code change it implemented—would greatly enhance the paper, making the "reasoning about reasoning" process more tangible and inspiring for future work.

3.  **Computational Cost of the Search Process:** Although the final system is efficient and generalizable, the initial discovery process for the ARM and meta-policy is likely very computationally expensive, involving numerous LLM calls for the reviewer agent and evaluations on a validation set. The paper does not quantify this cost or compare it directly to the training costs of baselines like ADAS and AFlow. A discussion of the computational budget required for discovery would provide a more complete picture of the method's practicality.

4.  **Potential Overfitting to the Validation Set:** The ARM is discovered using a 1000-sample subset of the Open-R1-Mixture-of-Thoughts dataset. While the strong performance on held-out benchmarks like LiveBench is reassuring, there remains a possibility that the evolutionary search overfits to the specific patterns and styles of reasoning in this particular dataset. A more robust analysis or discussion of this risk would strengthen the claims of generalizability.

### Summary

This is a high-quality paper that makes a significant contribution to the field of reasoning with LLMs. Its core strength lies in its paradigm-shifting idea: to advance reasoning, we should focus on improving the fundamental reasoning step rather than just the high-level orchestration. The results are robust, the methodology is sound and well-validated, and the emphasis on generalizability is a major practical advantage. The main weaknesses are primarily presentational—a somewhat steep initial conceptual curve and a lack of qualitative insight into the evolved modules—and a need for more explicit discussion of computational cost. Overall, it presents a compelling and likely influential new direction for building efficient and powerful reasoning systems.
