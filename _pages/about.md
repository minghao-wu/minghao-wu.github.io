I am currently on the job market. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/) in 2025, where I was advised by [Prof. Gholamreza (Reza) Haffari](https://rezahaffari.github.io/HomePage/HomePage.html). Before that, I received my M.Eng. degree in Information Technology from [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/) in 2018, under the supervision of [Prof. Trevor Cohn](https://trevorcohn.github.io/), and my B.Sc. degree in Statistics and Information Systems from [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/) in 2016. 

My research interests mainly lie in the following areas:

* **Language Agents**: My primary research interest is currently focused on multi-agent communication and collaboration. My recent work ([Wu et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11804)) proposed a multi-agent framework that mimics human translation workflows using language agents, achieving state-of-the-art results in literary translation tasks. 
* **Data Efficiency**: I have explored data-efficient methods for training language models, including fine-tuning large language models with heterogeneous data sources ([Wu et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08811), [Wang et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12300)), leveraging a bipartite graph to balance quality and diversity in data selection ([Wu et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12458)), and synthesizing large-scale datasets for fine-tuning language models ([Wu et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14402)).
* **Multilinguality and Machine Translation**: I have conducted research on multilinguality and machine translation, including multilingual supervised fine-tuning for large language models ([Li et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15011)), activation steering for cross-lingual transfer in multilingual language models ([Wang et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12462), [Wang et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12313)), multilingual process reward modeling ([Wang et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12663)), document-level machine translation ([Wu et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08079), [Wu et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15360), [Wu et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06468)), and multilingual evaluation ([Wu et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15521)).
* **Miscellaneous**: Additionally, I have contributed to various other topics, including large language model evaluation ([Wu and Aji, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03025)), multi-modal large language models ([Lyu et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09093), [Wang et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16511)), and recommender systems ([Zhang et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11441)).
